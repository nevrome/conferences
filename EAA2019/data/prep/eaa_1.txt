THE MATERIALITY OF HIGH ALTITUDES AND HIGH LATITUDES
Theme: Archaeology of mountainous landscapes
Organisers: Citter, Carlo (Siena University) - Tys, Dries (Vrije Universiteit Brussel)
Format: MERC Forum
Material culture depends on humans and humans depend on material culture. The entanglement between humans and things has
for a long time been part of the archaeological agenda, also in medieval and post-medieval archaeology. However, the relation
of material culture and people that live in marginal areas has hitherto received little attention. In the MERC Forum we invite medieval and post-medieval archaeologists to discuss with our Forum keynote speakers how material culture was part of the lives
of people living in high altitudes (mountainous landscapes such as the Alps, the Scottish Highlands or the Pyrenees) and in high
latitudes (roughly above c. 60Â° degree of latitude). Did people that live in such marginal areas have access to the same amount
and quality of material culture necessary for survival than people living in cities and densely settled areas? What artefacts were
considered essential for daily live, and did artefacts, which in other contexts would be considered luxury goods, enter these marginal areas too? How difficult was access to material culture and what sorts of material culture did they abstain from?
