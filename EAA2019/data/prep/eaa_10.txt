nected with the Ottonian Empire, the Piasts in Poland and the Arpáds in Hungary. The involvement of Bohemia in long-distance
trade and the presence of an important market in Prague were described by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub in the 960’s. Although there was no
shift in the geo-political orientation of Přemyslid dukes in the 11th century and there was likewise no significant change of metal
jewelry, the glass and amber adornments changed markedly. A substantial decrease in the number of beads can be linked to a
local transformation of burial customs and absence of necklaces in graves probably influenced by the Christianization process
after the year 1000. The decline of segmented and amber beads, together with an increased occurrence of rings and infrequent
other types of beads in hillforts and settlements, may reflect a change in fashion at the local or supra-regional level. They can
also indirectly indicate a shift in economy, for example in the routes of long distance exchange. In the 11th century, a boom of
adornments made from lead glass, both the high-lead ones, and the ternary ones containing wood-ash alkali is recorded, while
soda-lime glass typical of the 10th century became less frequent. Shift in the proportion of artifacts from glass of different
chemical composition can also be considered to reflect a global economic change.
