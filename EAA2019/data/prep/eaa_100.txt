archaeological studies.
This paper analyses the case of the indigenous culture of the Canary Islands, and its role in the current primary school textbooks.
Within the educational context, we analyse how heritage is portrayed in elementary school textbooks, comparing, for instance,
the case of the namely European/monumental heritage (Castilian monuments and buildings) versus the African/non-monumental heritage (Amazigh or ancient Canarian sites).
This paper highlights the role played by colonialism in archaeological heritage management and education. Our research analyses
the way in which monuments are preserved and understood by heritage professionals, teachers and the interested public. Finally,
we describe the numerous contradictions concerning the nature, origin, and context of the indigenous peoples.
