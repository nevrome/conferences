conceptual validity. This assessment tests specific questions pertinent to the relationship between prehistoric tool use and ecotones in an attempt to explain the presence or absence of particular artifact types and land use strategies through time. It also
reflects on issues caused by repeated occupations, palimpsest assemblages, and other taphomonic processes that influence
archaeological consensus. Results indicate separate phases in the initial colonization of Alaska and form a testable hypothesis
based on functional land use properties associated with the Denali complex era in a way that distinguishes it from other early technologies in the region. The approach contributes to a longstanding discussion over subjectivity among archaeological
categories and explains lithic assemblage variability in eastern Beringia with widespread implications for interpreting the initial
peopling of the Americas.
