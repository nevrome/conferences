In southern Peru our group is investigating a Paleoindian settlement system with linked sites situated in diverse ecological
zones and exhibiting different subsistence adaptations. This system encompasses one of the earliest coastal fishing sites in
the Americas and high-elevation hunting sites on the Andean plateau. Determining the nature of this and other early inter-zonal
connections is important for identifying routes used to settle Andean South America, with implications for colonization patterns
at the continental scale. Traditionally, inter-zonal links have been detected by identifying exotic materials and determining their
provenance, but this approach alone cannot distinguish single-group mobility from exchange between multiple groups. Early and
sustained transfers of projectile points between highlands and coast may be the key to resolving the nature of the inter-zonal
connection.
As artifacts that integrate socially learned stylistic information, projectile points provide a potential way to investigate the
strength of shared material culture among sites. In our comparative analysis of early assemblages from this region, we combine
insights from raw material provenance, morphological and stylistic attributes, and use-life histories of projectile points. Complementing this approach, we also examine burials and special personal objects that may help us to understand social identities and
connections across this complex landscape.
