PRODUCTION

Presentation Format: Oral
The discussion of identity in archaeology is strongly influenced by ideas and theory from disciplines such as sociology, social
psychology, ethnography and ethnology - all of which are grounded in present time or the recent past. But can we as archaeologists, with the limited material remains from past societies, really come close to understanding such complex terms as identity
and social groups dynamics in hunter-gatherer groups, existing thousands of years ago?
In this talk, I will approach the topics of identity and transmission of knowledge through material culture related to a technological concept centred on blade production, using pressure technique, from single fronted cores. In north-western Europe these
cores are known as handle cores. The small blades which are produced from these cores are often further worked, and used as
inserts in slotted bone points and as arrowheads. Handle cores were produced and used in many parts of northern Europe and
technological studies has shown variations in the production sequence in different regions. The investigation of these regional
variations could aid in understanding social networks, transmission of knowledge, and perhaps identity, in the hunter-gatherer
societies of northern Europe during the Mesolithic.
