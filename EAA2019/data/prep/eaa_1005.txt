Presentation Format: Oral
The period from the second half of 7th mil. to the end of 5th mil. cal BC on the territory of the Volga-Oka lowland (Central Russia)
was distinguished by a large variety of arrowheads and spear points. Most of them were made from the bones (antler) of elk. The
number of flint arrowheads is very small. Explanations of this phenomenon can be sought both in the specialization of weapons
and in the heterogeneity of the population who left the objects of material culture. This period is associated with the spread of
the first ceramics (without agriculture) and the formation of its production. Using the example of a multi-layered wetland site of
Zamostje 2 with a rich series of projectile points (arrows, spears, leisters, harpoons etc.) made from organic materials, it is possible to try to correlate the main types of points with cultural, technological, economic and paleo-ecological events in the region.
