The topic deals with a unique find form the Early Iron Age incineration necropolis from Valea Stânii, Ţiţeşti commune, Argeş
County (mid-Romania, South of Carpathians). In the single grave under barrow 10 (explored in 2016) appeared for the first time
attested in the Ferigile group the bronze arrowheads belonging to some different variants, leaf-shaped, trefoil and triangular
cross-section blade. Not less than 30 such arrowheads, some of them barbed (14 exemplars, trefoil and leaf-shaped), were deposited together with a “soldered” bulk composed by another around 10 thin, flat, and triangular iron copies belonging to the wellknown Ferigile type arrowhead, along with ash, charcoal and few calcined bones. Thus, the contemporaneity between the two
great types of arrows (bronze “Scythian” and iron Ferigile one) is demonstrated, as well as the fact that the Ferigile communities
were not so conservative about this type of weapon, anyway, at least not in the manner and extent that were suspected so far.
The arrowheads from Valea Stânii are typologically determined by reference to the analogies provided by different spaces and
cultural groups (the tombs of early Scythian culture North of the Black Sea and from forest-steppe zone, West Podolian cultural
group, Ciumbrud group in Transylvania, East-Hallstattian cultural zone etc.). The dating of this batch of arrowheads in the second
half of the 7th century BC (most likely only in the third quarter of the 7th century BC, ±650-625) rises some chronological issues
that may have significant implications for the general dating of the Ferigile cultural group.
