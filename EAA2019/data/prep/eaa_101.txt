The El Born CCM archaeological site in Barcelona (Cultural and Memorial Center) was discovered in 2001, when the Born building
was being converted into a public library. El Born is formed of 8,000 sq. m. of an uninterrupted urban area, up of 63 houses along
9 streets, dated from the end of the 13th century to the year 1717.
Currently, more than 60% of the site of El Born remains as it was in the early 18th century, intact. Accordingly, we can view El Born
as a living site that should still provide us with a wealth of information about how this neighborhood of Barcelona city evolved.
El Born CCM has promoted the ArqueoBorn program in order to vindicate and showcase the site’s archaeological remains and,
thus, give continuity to research through archaeological excavations with Archeology students in the University of Barcelona
and professional archaeologists. These are compulsory practices where students learn to dig, draw and classify materials from
medieval and post-medieval times. El Born collaborates with the University in the formation of students, through excavation and
master classes.
In this paper we focus on the role of the formative archeologist, and we will explain the experience of the last four excavation
campaigns.
