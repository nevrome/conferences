Jade was highly valued in different cultures of the world in prehistoric times. Several thousand jade axes have been found in Europe. They served as prestige objects a cultic or ceremonial purpose rather than a practical one. Copper or bronze axes replaced
the jade ones in the Chalcolithic, and subsequently jadeite axes found no use in Europe anymore. They fell into oblivion.
In Neolithic China, on the other hand, jade was also processed into axes, ritual tools and jewelry. However, a jade cult arose that
was handed down from generation to generation. This jade cult developed into the Chinese jade culture, which looks back on a
continuous, more than 7000-years history and has remained an integral part of the value system in China to this day.
How can these differences between the European and the Chinese way be explained? The answer could probably be found in the
origin of the Chinese jade culture. The discovery of Neolithic jade cultures in China (particularly Hongshan and Liangzhu cultures)
has weakened the long-established hypothesis that Chinese civilization had developed exclusively in the Yellow River basin. The
importance of jade objects within many different ethnic groups in areas far away from the future center of Chinese civilization
has been recognized. Various Neolithic jade objects found in burials of these ‘marginal areas’ indicate already mature and complex faith/religion systems and associated funeral rites (e.g. Lingjiatan and Xinglongwa cultures).
The differences in funeral inventory point to a stratified society that seems to possess considerable human and natural resources as well as a well-functioning organization system. Apparently, a division of labor and specialization took place already during
