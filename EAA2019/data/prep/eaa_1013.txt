Jadeitite was highly valued and used by pre-colonial Amerindian societies throughout the Greater Caribbean to produce daily
and ceremonial objects. Regionally, jadeitite sources are only known in Guatemala, north and south of the Motagua Fault Zone
(GM, NMFZ and SMFZ), eastern Cuba (CU) and the northern Dominican Republic (DR). Finds of exotic/non-local jadeitite artefacts
establishes exchange and transport over vast distances and provides fundamental information about former trading and mobility networks between different Caribbean islands and the mainland. Despite general geological similarities among the jadeitite
source rocks, different ages, protoliths, P-T conditions of jadeite formation and (re-)mobilization of different fluid compositions
offer the potential to geochemically discriminate the sources.
This paper provides a novel geochemical database of currently known Caribbean jadeitite and jadeite-omphacite-rich source
rocks to determine local and regional variation. The geochemical data are subjected to a multiclass-regression analysis to establish quantitatively how effectively the provenance of archaeological Caribbean lithic artefacts can be determined. The first
approach was to assess 3 jadeitite source regions (DR, CU, GM) based on trace element ratios and subsequently see if it was
possible to resolve 4 (DR, CU, GM NMFZ, GM SMFZ). Here we present the results of the discrimination model. The successful
analyses can be applied to artefacts of jadeititic composition of unknown provenance in the Greater Caribbean.
