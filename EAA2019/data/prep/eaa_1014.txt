The presence of artefacts made of jadeitite in pre-Columbian assemblages in the Caribbean has long been suspected by archaeologists. Their hypothesis was proven in 2006, when archaeologists and geologists combined and analyzed pre-Columbian lithic
celts excavated on Antigua. All the Antiguan jadeitite celts were assigned, as no other sources were known, to jadeitite cropping
out in the Motagua Valley, located in Guatemala some 3000 km away. In the last decade two more jadeitite sources were identified on eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic questioning Guatemala as only source for jadeitite objects found on
the Lesser Antilles Islands.
These findings had significant implication for the National Museum of Denmark, as it curates one of the largest pre-Columbian
collections from the Caribbean Islands outside of the Americas, including more than 1900 celts, a large percentage of which
appear to be made of a jadeitite. Furthermore, the collection covers all the Caribbean Islands from Trinidad in the Southeast to
Cuba in the West. However, only a smaller cross-disciplinary study in connection with the JADE II project had been attempted on
the suspected jadeitite artefacts in the collection until a collaboration with the large-scale international ERC-Synergy NEXUS
1492 Project started in January 2017.
Here we present novel data on the use-trace of jadeitite bodily ornaments and geochemical data of jadeitite celts retrieved from
the Caribbean Islands contributing to a holistic view on lithic artefacts including raw material collection, production, use and
distribution of the objects. This study demonstrates that the Pan-Caribbean exchange of jadeitite raw materials, pre-forms or
finished quotidian and ceremonial objects during the ceramic periods (500 BC to 1550 AD), occurred on a more complex scale
than previously thought including jadeitite sources in Guatemala, eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic.
