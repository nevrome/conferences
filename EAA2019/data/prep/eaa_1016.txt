For several reasons, St. Martin greenstone is a remarkable stone material that can be found in archaeological contexts in the
Caribbean. First, St. Martin greenstone is a confusing name of archaeologists. The rock, when found in archaeological context,
does not have a green appearance at all. The rock has a clear green colour when freshly exploited, but it gradually turns into a
grayish, whitish chalky material with corroded and crumbly surfaces as result of chemical weathering. Second, this material is
known to have a very limited natural occurrence. It can only be exploited at St. Martin. However, this did not prevent the material
to be distributed all over the Caribbean. In addition, outside St. Martin, this greenstone is only found in the form of finished ground
tools. This indicates that the objects were manufactured in St. Martin, and distributed as finished products.
One of the sites in which St. Martin greenstone objects were found is the Chemin de M. de l’Orme site at the Eastern Caribbean
island of La Désirade. This paper will discuss the special context of this site, one of the few ceremonial pre-colonial sites at this
island, and the possibly political and cultural significance of this find.
