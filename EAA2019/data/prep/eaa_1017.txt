The discovery of both jadeitite artefacts and sources in the Caribbean has produced novel insights into the regional circulation
of greenstone celts during the Ceramic Age. Long-distance exchange ties have been demonstrated, and studies highlight that
stone celt production was often monopolised by certain communities. Nevertheless, much remains unclear about the importance attributed to particular raw materials, the technologies used to manufacture celts, the social effects that drove their
circulation and were produced by it, and so on. Here, we discuss the biographical analysis of four celt assemblages containing
diverse raw materials from Grenada and the Dominican Republic. This involved an experiment-based study of microscopic traces
of wear relating to the operational sequence and function of the artefacts. We demonstrate that jadeitite celt biographies are
not significantly different from those made of other raw materials, that morphologies change over time as a result of use, and
that movements across spatial contexts are social and technological necessities during the life cycle of celts.
