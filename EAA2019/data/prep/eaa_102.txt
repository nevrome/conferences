TEACHING HERITAGE: PRESENTING PREHISTORY IN ENGLISH PRIMARY SCHOOLS

Presentation Format: Oral
Once upon a time, the teaching of history in English primary schools began with the Roman Invasion in AD43. In 2013, however,
a much-debated redesign saw the introduction of the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Ages (the term ‘prehistory’ is not actually
used) into the National Curriculum at Key Stage 2 (7-11 years). This presented a significant challenge to teachers, and not only
because they were themselves unfamiliar with the period: this vast new topic spanned millennia and included complex and abstract concepts which, for younger children, could be difficult to convey. Further, the lack of characters and of dramatic events
and reliance on archaeological evidence meant that different approaches were needed. Five years on, how is the teaching of
prehistory now going? The Ancient Identities Today project, at Durham University and Stirling University (funded by the Arts and
Humanities Research Council) has been exploring aspects of 21st century engagement with Iron Age and Roman past. In this
paper we present observations based on interviews with educators, and ethnographic fieldwork at open-air heritage venues.
Heritage organisations, both public and private, have clearly responded to the need for improved access to information about
prehistory. Local museums and open-air venues developed new resources and educational opportunities, and found an appreciative audience. Our research suggests, however, a number of issues with the current syllabus and the way in which the crucial interface between ‘prehistory’ and ‘history’ is presented. But how important is detail and accuracy at this level? Should Key Stage
2 History be simply about engagement and inspiration—about local connections and empathy—rather than evidence, context
and critical thinking? Or can we aim for all of these?
