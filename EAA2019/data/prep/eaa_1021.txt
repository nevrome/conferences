reached the Neolithic groups of Friuli Venezia Giulia and coastal Istria as early as the second half of the 6th millennium BC, during
the Danilo/Vla≈°ka culture. The exchange of this and other classes of lithic artefacts testifies that in this period this area was
fully integrated into long-distance exchange systems that used mainly coastal routes. These systems would have continued in
the 5th millennium BC, as indicated by a few oversized jade axe blades and other materials. Far from the coast, jade axes entered
central Slovenia, probably reaching sites of the Sava Group of the Lengyel culture in the first half of the 5th millennium BC. In
roughly the same period, shafthole axes made of Bohemian metabasites spread over central and south eastern Europe, crossed
the Alps and reached Italy. According to different Neolithic traditions, during the 5th millennium BC Europe appears to be divided
into a jade-using western area and a central-eastern BM-using one.
