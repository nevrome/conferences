AGE

The largest known jadeitite source in the Aegean is located on the Cycladic island of Syros. During sampling, several patinated
flakes and preforms of considerable age were identified, demonstrating, for the first time, the presence of several knapping
places around the large jadeite boulders. In order to classify the specific trace elements from the source of Syros a series of
investigations has been initiated using radiospectrometry, XRD, and ICP-analysis.
In connection with the study of jadeitite axe assemblages in the Aegean and Anatolia, several Neolithic and early Bronze Age
sites contain these rare objects together with other axes made of nephtite, and hematite, thus allowing a comparison between
geological sources and archaeological artefacts. The results indicated that the axes originated from jadeite sources in the Italian
Alps, the local source on Syros and unknown sources. The nephrite and hematite sources are still unknown, but comparisons
between the polished axes indicates the presence of previously unknown exchange networks within the neolithic and bronze age
societies in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
