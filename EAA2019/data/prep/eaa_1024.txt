BRONZE AGE MONUMENTS IN THE WITHAM VALLEY, LINCOLNSHIRE: THE INVESTIGATION OF EIGHT
ROUND BARROWS AND THEIR LANDSCAPE SETTING
Author(s): Chowne, Peter (University of York)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper builds on research initially reported at the 15th Annual Meeting of the EAA and subsequently published in 2015. A
number of barrow complexes on the Lincolnshire Fen Margin and in the valley of the River Witham were described with LiDAR
enhancing our understanding of the partially buried landscapes in which the monuments were constructed.
In 2016-18 an opportunity to arose for the excavation and recording of the Canwick/Washingborough group of four round barrows south of the River Witham and the Greetwell group of four north of the river in advance of road construction. The development enabled the near total excavation of a 300 metre wide transect through the peat-filled river valley.
The paper will describe the development of the monument complex, funerary practices and the condition of the archaeological monuments and palaeoenvironmental remains and the significant implications for the management and preservation of the
barrows outside the road corridor and complexes elsewhere in the Witham Valley. Although post-excavation analysis has only
just commenced it is clear that when complete, the results of these investigations will transform our understanding of barrow
landscapes in the region.
