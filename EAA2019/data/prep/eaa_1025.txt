It is well known that Neolithic megalithic landscapes are the result of complex locational logics governing where communities
chose to site their funerary monuments. These logics in turn respond to broader environmental and cultural affordances, and the
relationship between these has been a major topic in the megalithic archaeological literature for the last few decades. Thanks
to both new approaches in spatial statistical modelling, and a further novel method for testing site hierarchy that is introduced
in this presentation, there is now considerable opportunity to revisit traditional megalithic locational concepts from a more systematic point of view, not least in Galician studies (NW Iberian Peninsula) but also in other territories. In the research that follows,
we apply such a modelling approach to a large set of megalithic monuments located in the south of Galicia (Monte Penide and
surroundings) with a view to exploring locational choices, spatial hierarchy and territoriality in these funerary landscapes.
