results of the investigations at Tunnug 1 in Tuva Republic. Being located in a swamp, constructive wood from the burial architecture is excellently preserved (Dated through wiggle-matching between 833 and 800 BC (95.4%)), however, its strange position
in the landscape make both surveys and excavation a difficult endeavour. The 2018 campaign has begun to reveal the complex
internal architecture of the monument and further research in 2019 will uncover large parts of the burial mound.
