This paper explores a specific landscape in the central and southwestern part of Salas council (NW Iberian Peninsula), which contains five prehistoric cemeteries chronologically framed between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age periods: San Juan, Corradas,
Idarga and Penausen-Calabazos.
The most remarkable site is the dolmen of Cobertoria, where the ongoing excavations are providing detailed information about
the sequence of burial practices: a chamber with monumental orthostats dated in the 3500 BC. However, previous phases have
been identified in the tomb: first, a stone burial mound was built around the 4000 BC and second, a ring of red clay was constructed nearly 3700 BC. The results of a cross-tab analysis of the composition of the clay used in this prehistoric structure and clay
samples from the surroundings allow us to establish considerations about the time consumed from the original quarry to the site.
The main goal of this presentation is to show how we can extend similar links between the quarries and the group of megalithic
chambers by using airborne LiDAR techniques to identify possible outcrops. Overall, these prehistoric spaces will be analysed
from a geological point of view, using LiDAR to identify the original position of the raw materials. Although three of the cemeteries
have no scientific excavations, field survey works have allowed us to establish preliminary hypothesis about the internal composition of the tumulus, as it occurs in Idarga’s cemetery, where the enormous quantities of stones present in the surface of the
hill show the presence of building materials in the nearby funerary space.
Finally, the distances gathered at the end of the analysis will allow us to carry out a most detailed approach to the indigenous
communities, the type of the materials used in each case as well as the connections between the quarries and the tombs.
