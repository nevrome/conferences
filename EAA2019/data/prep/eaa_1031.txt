The Bielska Plain lies in north-eastern Poland. It occupies 2800 km2, of which over 35% is occupied by woodland areas. Among
them one of the oldest forests in Europe, the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, a UNESCO heritage site. In the entire Bielska Plain, over
2000 chronologically and morphologically different mounds were located by remote sensing with the use of ALS. However, the
ratio of the number of mounds from the Bialowieza Forest to the mounds from the rest of the discussed area is ca. 80:20%. This
is due to the very well-preserved features with their own anthropogenic landform forming the archaeological landscape. This
situation results from the unique nature of protection of the Białowieża Forest, where intense ploughing was highly limited since
the fifteenth century. Thanks to this, in this closed area, we can observe a landscape full of mounds in almost unchanged form.
In the Białowieża Primeval Forest, prehistoric and early medieval burial mounds coexist with modern traces of the use of forest
resources manifesting themselves as a charcoal and a tar kilns. For archaeologist this case creates a unique opportunity for
comparative studies between the primeval forest and its currently economically used neighboring areas.
