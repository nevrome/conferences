The number of archaeological works in Russia has increased due to active constructing. Often terms of the excavation are strictly limited. So we need an appropriate method of work which will allow to explore the monument carefully and in a short time.
The report is devoted to the results of the archaeological excavations of the Darino-2 barrow field. Eight mounds and cultural
layer were studied. The method of work consisted of the following stages:
Dividing each mound into 4 sectors, formed by the intersection of 2 stratigraphic baulks. Removing layers according to the relief
of the ground surface. Cleaning, drawing and photo of surface after removing of the first layer. Researching a barrow mound embankment through the layers. Fixation the site of each find in accordance with stratigraphic layers. Fixation the plundererâ€™s pits,
grave pits and small ditches at the level from which each mound is poured. Removing layer of buried soil. Cleaning and fixation of
virgin soil. Studying the stratigraphy of each mound in the baulks. Removing baulks by hands.
During the excavation A.A. Goleva investigated the soil of mounds. They had almost identical stratigraphy. Under the mounds a
layer of buried soil was identified. This indicates that the place was mastered by people long before the making of barrows. All
mounds were piled on arable land. The presence of carbonaceous fractions indicates the slash-and-burn method of cleaning the
area. Thus the territory near the settlement was used for the making of burial mounds.
The studied burials are dated to the period of the XII-XIII centuries.
So this method of work has allowed us to study the stratigraphy of mounds and get information about the stages of development
of this area.
