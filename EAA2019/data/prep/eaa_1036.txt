Neolithic stone axes and adzes are usually interpreted as tools shaped and used mainly for woodworking and specially tree felling. However, only a few archaeological experiments were documented so far. Our program has been designed to understand how
efficient these tools are and how their typology is significant.
This communication is about recent experiments which took place in Brittany (France), implementing various types of reconstituted axes and adzes based on local archaeological artefacts. We performed different techniques on trees from various diamet.
Thanks to the 3D models of the tools we made before and after the tree felling, we can measure the evolution of the shape and
the wear of the cutting edge.
By typo-functional analysis, the objective of this work is to understand why the typology of the polished stones is that varied and
how they are linked to the tree felling techniques. Furthermore we wish to create a reference collection for use-wear analysis.
