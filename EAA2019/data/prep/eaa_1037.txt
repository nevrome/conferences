Investigations at Karancsság-Alsó-rétek, a multi-component site (2 Phases of LBK, Lengyel and 10-11th Century AD) in northern
Hungary, began with the opening of three excavation blocks in 2002.
We excavated 84 features in the 3 blocks and collected samples (animal bones, malacology and stone artefacts) from ca. 72
m3 (100-120 t) of anthrosol. In 2008 and 2010 we took 3 core samples from the site and adjacent the stream. Samples were
subjected to soil chemical, sedimentological, palynological, and malacological analyses.
The Neolithic farming was very similar in the three different settlement phases, but a few differences were observed in the
animal husbandry. The most important domestic animals were goat, sheep, cattle and pig. Hunting for meat was a complementary activity, and the forest provided the opportunity to gather nuts, fruits and antlers. Cultivated garden plots could have been
located near the houses or the border of the settlement; the original luvisol had pH conducive to Neolithic cultivation practices.
We could reconstruct a cycles of Neolithic settlement and abandonment in the valley of the Ménes stream. The significant
human activity associated with occupation transformed the natural environment permanently only from the Late Bronze Age.
