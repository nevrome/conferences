Palynological research in context of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in the area of the Funnelbeaker North Group has a long
tradition. New research during the last decade, including new analyses and re-dating of old records, however, raises the need for
a revision of environmental change and land-use strategies during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. A region with an above-average number of well dated pollen profiles is the area of Eastern Schleswig-Holstein and Western Mecklenburg in Northern Germany, which will be in focus of the presented study. Hereby, results from different archive types (on-, near- and off-site) provide
evidence for human activities on different spatial scales. Palynological analyses of near shore sediments in context of archaeological sites (near-site) allow insights into the local vegetation and settlement dynamics. Combining these with archaeobotanical and -zoological results (on-site) indicate a change of the prevailing subsistence strategy during the Late Mesolithic to Early
Neolithic period supporting the idea of a step-wise adoption of agricultural elements. Based on the evidence from regional pollen
diagrams, i.e. off-site lake sediment records, these changes can be further attributed to different phases of human environmental impact on a larger spatial scale.
