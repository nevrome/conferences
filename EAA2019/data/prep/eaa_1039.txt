In contrast to most of the 20th century, archaeology is nowadays working with large-scale datasets comprising diverse information on artefacts, sites, radiocarbon dates, or archaeobotanical and archaeozoological samples. Due to the current development
of the computational techniques and capacities, these datasets can be also processed, analysed and used in diverse ways.
The current globalized society is facing major environmental changes and it is concluded that human activities stand behind it.
One of the most significant anthropogenic transformations of the environment was the change of land cover through land use.
With the beginning of the Neolithic, humans significantly cleared forests for setting up their fields and pastures, they managed
the woodland in order to gain firewood and fodder, and all this had an impact on the vegetation and climate. In this paper we will
