a model of four spheres, which I have named PWNW (Personal, Wider, Nation, World). The model presented has been developed
through a pedagogical exercise called “the heritage bag” and it is a result of many lectures, presentations and performances
during the last 10 years.
Through the model PWNW I claim that students, pupils and others participating in the Heritage bag exercise changes their perception of what heritage means. It has been proven to be an effective tool in teaching and learning about heritage in primary
schools, high schools and universities as well as within informal learning situations.
