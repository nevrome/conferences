over the heavier and fragile ceramic. Other organic containers, such leather pouches were flexible and robust compared to the
ceramic counterparts. Expansive baskets or flexible nets, as three-dimensional containers, may have had a huge advantage over
ceramic containers. The function of coiled baskets used for heat is currently being examined.
The Striking collection of ceramic from the Horgener Culture group, 3400 and 2800 BC, in the region of west Switzerland and
southern Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, that is recognised for its coarse, thick-walled and cylindrical style, may indirectly indicate why no
fine ceramic has been located and that this type of ceramic was compensated for by organic containers. Basically, the question
arises as to what extent ceramics were influenced by the organic containers and what significance these have for early, agricultural based cultures and what conclusions can be drawn from this for the importance of textile manufacture.
