The THEFBO research project is attempting to shed light on the importance of textile products for the early agricultural settlers
as they began a more sedentary lifestyle. As often mentioned, livestock and domesticating crops are milestones in the context
of sedentariness. Terms like ”pre-ceramic” indicate how significant ceramic vessels were in this context and there is no question
that implements made of stone, silex, bone or wood were all essential for early agricultural settlements on a day-to-day basis.
The significance of textiles, however, remains largely unresolved often only coming to light in the context of linen and wool and
the process of weaving.
In this context, the focus of this EAA-session is on organic containers. Their exposure should help to highlight their emphasis and
support a different approach when considering the ceramic spectrum of Neolithic cultural groups, such as Horgen culture. Which
functions did the organic container have and was it possibly correlated with the ceramic vessel? Organic containers in their
entirety, are lightweight, break-resistant, flexible, heat-retaining and waterproof, a far broader range of applications are open to
this type of vessel in comparison to the fragile ceramic which was indispensable mainly because of the resistance to heat. The
session serves as the first assessment and basis for open discussion on this topic.
