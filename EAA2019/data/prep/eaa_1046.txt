For more than the last 100 years ceramic was the main archaeological artefact category for Neolithic studies in central Europe.
While ceramics was seldom analysed to reconstruct its use and function in day to day life, it mainly helped to define archaeological cultures and determine chronotypological phases.
Mostly from the 1990ies onward an overwhelming amount of LBK wooden wells where discovered, excavated and analysed in
central Europe. It is from there that we learnt to know about completely new categories of vessels and containers, mainly made
out of thinned bark or sheets of bast. Most of them are interpreted as vessels to fetch water and this not only because they
have been found in wells â€“ which is but a matter of the preservation possibilities. The used material and the construction differs
slightly, but we already can define different some types, which allow us to also recognise bark and bast fragments which are not
well preserved. We will present about a dozen examples from LBK-wells, which have been discovered in Northwestern Saxony and
show, that ceramics must have formed only a small part of household inventory of containers.
