Gaps in research have potential to expand our knowledge if the information is recognised. A good example are the bark containers and their importance in everyday life of early agricultural orientated settlements. In the archaeological context, bark vessels
are often refer to as Russian birch pots, which seems to have been passed on in the context of folklore. Less known, however, is
that the Nordic relatives were not only using these containers as boxes but also, after making necessary changes, using them as
thermos flasks in order to keep hot liquids warm. Comparing the finds from Neolithic lake settlements around the foothills of the
Alps with the finds made of Russian birch made boxes did not succeed especially in terms of quality of the birch because this was
grown in a climate that differs from central Europe and is therefore not suitable for producing bark vessels. However, so-called
“Omele” which are still used as containers made from lime bark in the southern German town of Belsen during the cherry harvest, have shed light on a previously grey area of research. These lightweight and unbreakable containers have an unmistakable
advantage over ceramic vessels. Findings from Alpine region lake-side settlements that have been analyzed appear to exhibit
similar seam techniques in terms of manufacturing technology. Findings from the Swiss settlement of Yverdon (Kanton Waad)
