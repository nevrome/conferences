Due to its flexible and water-repellent nature birch bark has been widely used through history for the production of a variety of
objects, ranging from vessels, shoes, hats to canoes and manuscripts. However, knowledge on the material itself and its processing in the archaeological context is limited because archaeological finds made of birch bark are extremely rare compared to
the number of inorganic finds usually discovered. Bark, like most organic materials is preserved either in waterlogged environments or ice patches/permafrost.
This presentation will introduce the material birch bark, its properties and the processing from the harvest to the production of
objects. A special focus will be put on the earliest example of a bow case ever found. This Neolithic bow case is made of birch
bark, measures 1.7 m in lengths and is dated to 2850 BC. Between 2003 and 2005 it thawed out of a receding ice patch at the
Schnidejoch Pass in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. It is an archaeological object of outstanding value, since it is the only existing bow case from prehistoric Europe and is the only Neolithic birch bark container built of differently orientated and superimposed strips. A detailed description of the complex structure gives information on the technology available to Neolithic hunters.
The properties of birch bark illustrated in the talk will explain why they used birch bark as manufacturing material to protect the
bow.
