WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE IN AN OPEN LEARNING FRAMEWORK

Presentation Format: Oral
In 2018 the University of Sydney introduced Open Learning Environment (or OLE) units into degree programs across the university. These units were introduced and designed with the aim of diversifying the experience of the student cohort across the
University, and the specific agenda delivered to individual departments was to present a topic which could be considered broadly
relevant to an audience outside their discipline. Students are required to take between two and six of these almost entirely online
OLE units, however, as they do not count towards a major, yet are mandatory for the satisfaction of degree requirements, it has
generally been thought that unit selection would be informed either by the desire to learn a particular skill, or for pure interest.
The Department of Archaeology decided upon cultural heritage, or more precisely the World Heritage List, as its departmental
offering. In selecting this topic, it is hoped that students across the humanities in diverse majors and degree programs will see
an area in which they can both make use of their own expertise and extend their learning experience. The unit interrogates UNESCOâ€™s Outstanding Universal Value criteria, explores the legal frameworks on which the World Heritage Convention is built, and
encourages students to consider the impact of politics and process on sites inscribed upon the World Heritage List. This paper
will provide an overview of the unit, including demographic information about the students who chose to add it to their programs,
and both a pedagogical and heritage-focussed reflection on the experience.
