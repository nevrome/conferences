Pottery is one of the numerically largest find category in archaeology. As a result, it has received and still receives much attention in research. Pottery has undoubtedly played a significant role in Neolithic everyday life. Nevertheless, this dominance within
the finds is only due to the fact that pottery outlasted the millennia in almost any soil environment, while organic materials have
preserved only under specific conditions.
The importance of organic containers in Neolithic everyday life, however, has hardly been studied. Though, organic containers
must have played an important role in the Neolithic household, as several finds from the circum-alpine pile-dwelling settlements
show. Especially in the Horgen culture mostly only large cooking pots and storage containers were made of pottery, while other
containers such as dishes, bowls, cups and ladles were made of wood. In particular, the so-called Horgen cups are in their filigree
in stark contrast to the coarse and thick-walled Horgen pottery. For some so far unexplored reasons, the Horgen culture group
obviously preferred wood for the production of certain vessel shapes. But even before and after the Horgen culture wooden
containers were present in the houshold inventory, though not so numerous.
Taking into account the poorer chances of preservation, wooden containers may have been as important as pottery, or were
perhaps even produced in larger quantities, as it can be assumed for the Horgen culture.
Using examples from selected pile-dwelling settlements of Southern Germany and Switzerland, Neolithic wooden containers
are highlightened and their advantages and disadvantages compared to pottery are shown. In addition, consideration is given to
where wooden containers could have acted as a supplement or as a counterweight to pottery.
