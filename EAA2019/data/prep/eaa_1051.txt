During recent excavations at the site of Zürich-Versicherung (Switzerland), six superimposed Neolithic and one Bronze age occupations were found. Some of the layers presented excellent waterlogged conditions of preservation. Due to the high interest
of the site a rather infrequent systematic grab sampling of large fragments of charred organic material was undertaken. The goal
of this was primarily towards the documentation of potential food remains similar to those discovered in the nearby location
of Zürich-Parkhaus Opéra. These objects were individually checked under the binocular and, unexpectedly, more than a dozen
of fragments of vase-like charred organic objects were found, belonging to the Corded Ware occupation about 2700 BC. Three
of these objects were investigated with a Raster-Electron microscope and multiple plant components were detected (straw,
grains, leaf fragments, trichomes), all indicative of their organic nature and, most likely, of the fact that the raw material for their
production was dung.
