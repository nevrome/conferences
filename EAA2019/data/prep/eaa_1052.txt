For this presentation we will also include micromorphology analyses aiming for a more fine-scale reconstruction of the production process of these vessels and we will eventually put their investigation into a wider context of the use of dung as raw material
in traditional societies and the purposes of dung-made containers. Similar containers might be present in other settlements
but the chances that they get preserved are very low. In this case, it was only thanks to the charring process, their in situ recovery during the excavation and the waterlogged preservation conditions, which are also more favourable for the preservation of
charred remains.
