DECIPHERING FUNCTIONS, ROLES AND MEANINGS OF CONTAINERS IN MOBILE SOCIETIES: A VIEW
FROM THE NORTHERN FORESTS

Presentation Format: Oral
Ceramic vessels have been an integral part of the material culture of many mobile hunter-gatherer groups in Afro-Eurasia and
the Americas ever since their first appearance in Late Glacial Eastern Asia, and we know today that pottery is by no means necessarily connected to sedentary lifestyles. Over the last years, much research has been devoted to the origins and typological
developments as well vessel use and functions of early hunter-gatherer pottery across Northern Eurasia.
Due to the nature of the evidence, however, our understanding of container technology and use is probably severely biased
towards ceramics in comparison to vessels made from organic materials that generally perish from the archaeological record.
Questions concerning the technological and social significance of ceramics within this continuum remain largely open and often
even unasked: What are functional properties, advantages and disadvantages of vessels and containers of different materials
such as bark, woven or knotted bast, carved wood, sewn horn but also pottery and metal? How important are combinations of
materials, and how might organic parts and components have influenced pottery vessel morphology, functionality, and style?
How do technological properties, material values and non-functional aspects influence possible symbolic and ritual connotations and uses of vessels made from different materials?
The talk will draw on ethnohistoric and ethnoarchaeological evidence from the Western Siberia taiga to investigate the spectrum of organic and inorganic containers used by historic and contemporary hunter-gatherer-fisher communities, and to identify
associated technologies, roles and meanings. The information will be discussed against a wider background of archaeological
evidence from North Eurasian mobile societies and from ethnographic records from the Northeast American forest zone.
