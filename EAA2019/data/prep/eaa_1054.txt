LEATHER OF THE LAKE – PREHISTORIC UTILISATION OF FISH SKIN PRODUCTS AROUND LAKE
CONSTANCE

Presentation Format: Oral
Fish skin, whether used raw or processed into leather, is a material in many ways similar to the skins and hides of mammals, reptiles and birds. Yet there are differences and not just in the technological sense. Fish skin might have had its own socio-economical specifics. While archaeological finds of mammal skin and leather are uncommon, yet known, we have almost no finds of fish
skin products. Our sources are therefore found mainly in ethnographic studies, where the use of fish skin is well documented.
Evidence is mainly from the colder regions, but not exclusively.
In my presentation I will try to recognize the relations between fish skin use and other factors. These include climate, society,
available resources, and belief systems. By applying these findings to the Lake Constance area I will discuss the possibility of
fish skin being utilised by the local prehistoric populations. The results could then provide a basis for further studies in different
regions of Europe and the world.
