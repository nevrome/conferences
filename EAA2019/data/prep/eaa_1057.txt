Looking at the objects that can be found in a Neolithic household the question often arises whether the displayed organic containers are only used for storing solid food or if they had different functions. Especially with coiled baskets this assumption must
be questioned. Finds of coiled baskets with adhere burnt remains of food suggest that they have been used for the preparation
or fermentation of food and perhaps also for cooking. Ethnological comparisons seem to confirm this assumption, as there are
groups of First Nations in North America that did not use any pottery at all. For cooking they used coiled baskets among others.
Against this background, the high number of archaeological findings of coiled baskets from the southern German lakeside settlements seems to get a different meaning. This assumption is intensified when the facts are added that the finds have different
shapes, that they are often burned and more often remains of food adhere to the coiled baskets. In order to provide a better
understanding of their function and thus of their importance in a Neolithic household, coiled baskets will be examined in more
detail within the framework of the textile project “THEFBO” . In order to get an indication for what kind of food was prepared in
the coiled baskets, the burned food remains will be analysed. Based on these results, the determination of the manufacturing
technique and the raw materials, the efficiency of coiled baskets in the preparation of food and in the storage of solid and liquid
foods will be checked experimentally.
