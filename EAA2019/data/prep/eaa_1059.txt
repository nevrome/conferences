Presentation Format: Poster
Vessels and containers in prehistory had varied functions and purpose, they could be made of clay, wood or other material, and
were produced by craftsmen in workshops of various specialisations. It seems that vessels made of organic material were commonly used by the Przeworsk culture population, which is confirmed, among others, by the numerous metal fittings of wooden
caskets and buckets discovered in burials from the Roman period.
The studies of the organic vessels are to some extent possible through the analysis of analogical ceramic vessels. Among the
typical sets of tableware, kitchenware and storage vessels commonly used in everyday life, the rare category of bucket-shaped
vessels draws attention. It is probable that this category of pottery dated mostly to the Late Roman period and the Migration
period, can be interpreted as clay imitation of wooden buckets. This claim is demonstrated by their characteristic form, as well
as the horizontal handle attached to the rim, and in some cases also by the style of decoration that could have been inspired by
the shape of wooden examples.
The poster aims to present the rare category of the pottery vessel form the Przeworsk culture that seems to be inspired by the
organic original. Interestingly, despite its simplicity, it seems that this type of vessels was used only during the short period
