Presentation Format: Oral
For a long time, peripheral space - either on a local or on a regional scale - has not played a major role in archaeological research.
This has recently changed, however, and various current research projects systematically investigate peripheries from different, often transdisciplinary perspectives by looking at economic, environmental, social and cultural aspects. The key research
questions of the recent approaches can be narrowed down to the following: What happened in peripheral zones and how can we
identify this archaeologically? What role played peripheral space in the everyday life of prehistoric people? And last but not least
how “peripheral” is peripheral space? These questions are addressed using methods deriving from archaeology, geoarchaeology,
archaeobotany, archaeozoology or archaeological sciences. We would like to introduce our session with an overview of current
developments in the field of research on peripheral space with the aim of interconnecting the following presentations and pinpointing future developments in this field.
