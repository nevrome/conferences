PERIPHERY IS THE NEW CENTER. ON CHANGING PATTERNS IN LBK SETTLEMENT DISTRIBUTION AND
ORGANISATION

Presentation Format: Oral
While all typochronological aspects of LBK-settlement organisation in space and time mainly rely on densely distributed finds
and features in what is called or thought to be the center of a settlement, the ‘poorer’ periphery of it is mostly unknown, sometimes superficially checked or even neglected. This is not only due to the need of large amounts of archaeological material to
analyse it in order to sequence and interpret it, but also a matter of the possibility of doing comparable large surface analysis.
Detailed analytical studies often must limit to small excavated, mostly ‘central’ settlement areas or in the best case to the ‘richer’ parts of larger ones. If excavated at all, less dense settlement areas cannot be analysed in the same way, mostly because of
the simple reason that there is less or no comparable archaeological material at all. While the factual problem cannot be changed,
the methodological aspect strongly has to be regarded while trying to draw larger pictures of settlement organisation during
LBK. These aspects will be highlighted by a number of key settlement excavations and studies in the region of Northwestern
Saxony, Germany.
