lignite opencast mining in the Rhineland/Northwest Germany opens up the possibility for extensive diachronic archaeological
survey programs that are not focused on limited areas within selected settlement sites or cemeteries. In the context of the
“LANU-Project” (Prehistoric Land Use in the Rhenish Opencast Mining Area) systematic surveys in the periphery of prehistoric
settlements (Neolithic to Metal Ages) are conducted in search of off-site features. This involves a combination of different
approaches including field survey, geomagnetic survey and test trenches. The project aims at gaining a better understanding of
the role and use of peripheral space. This is complemented by a collection of data on already known off-site features from this
area. Together with new discoveries the collected data provides the basis for a systematic comparison of off-site and on-site
features/finds facilitating a more detailed characterization and differentiation. The paper will present methodological aspects
and first results of the project.
