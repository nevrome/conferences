Presentation Format: Oral
The Roman town of Colonia Ulpia Traiana (CUT) was located in what is now Xanten but never saw any further construction in post
Roman time. Archaeological research and excavations have been carried out in the area of CUT since the 16th century and particularly since the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the LVR Archaeological Park (APX) in 1973. Thanks to legislation
protecting archaeological monuments, archaeologists have today an opportunity to explore all facets of a Roman town in one
of the north-western provinces. The APX is an ideal environment for future archaeologists to learn their craft in the field and to
improve on their existing skills. A four-year research project (2016-2019) run by the Archaeological Institute of the University of
Cologne on one hand provides a training opportunity with regard to all aspects of modern excavation, including 3D surveying and
3D documentation, and on the other allows researchers to scientifically study a hitherto largely unknown residential quarter of
CUT (Insula 22) in greater detail.
The primary focus of the excavations is a large multi-phase building on the northern periphery of the ancient quarter from the
time of the colonia (from the late 1st century AD onwards), one of the features of which was an elaborately designed entrance
area with a water basin. Pits full of a vast array of materials found beneath this building point to an early phase of Roman settlement in Xanten which began in the early 1st century AD.
Within my presentation I want to have a look on the periphery of Roman Towns. Has there been the quiet place for the wealthy
people or the place for craftsmen’s establishments or the place for lower class people?
