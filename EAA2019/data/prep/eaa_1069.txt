suited for identification of the social, economic, and environmental elements which may reflect several implications for the
nature and spatial configuration of land use. The settlements and cemeteries cover more than 1000 years (ca. 5000-3900 cal.
BC) and belong to Boian and Gumelnita communities.
Based on archaeological, micromorphological, topographical, GIS, zooarchaeological, malacological, palynological and carpological data, the current paper will explore the development of local communities from Sultana-Malu Roșu along the 1000 years in
terms multiple land-use (e.g. for habitation, burying the dead, other economic activities), exploitation of the environment (natural
resources) and human impact.
Moreover, the situation from Sultana-Malu Roșu site allows identifying how the peripheral concept is differentiated perceived by
the past communities following changes recorded in the land-use patterns over time.
