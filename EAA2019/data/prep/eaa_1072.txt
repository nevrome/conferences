IN THE THICK OF IT OR IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE? – ROCK-SHELTERS DURING PREHISTORY

Presentation Format: Oral
Prehistoric rock-shelter sites (also known by the French term abri) often have thick deposits that preserve long-term records of
human activity. As such they represent important archaeological archives.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, excavations in abris and cave entrances were a popular focus for archaeological research. Numerous sites were excavated, especially those with Palaeolithic remains, although abris with younger prehistoric
material were also investigated. Later on, such sites tended to be rather neglected by archaeological research, so few have
been excavated to modern standards and the role of rock-shelters within prehistoric economic and social networks is still rather
unclear. Often interpreted as being peripheral sites that were only used for short-term occupations from the Neolithic onwards,
they became of marginal interest for scientific discussion.
Abri Unterkobel (Oberriet SG) is situated within the Alpine Rhine Valley in north-eastern Switzerland. Excavated between 2011
and 2012, the site has yielded large quantities of archaeological material that span from the Early Mesolithic to the Roman
period. The excavation used modern techniques that included large-scale sieving and a comprehensive sampling program. The
results of an ongoing interdisciplinary research project studying the archaeological, geoarchaeological and bioarchaeological
remains, has revealed new insights into the use of this abri during prehistory.
The aim of this presentation is to shed new light on the function and role of rock-shelter sites during prehistory. The example of
Abri Unterkobel and other sites in the Alpine Rhine Valley will be presented and compared with recently investigated abri sites in
other regions of Europe.
