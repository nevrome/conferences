LIVING IN HIGH ALPINE LIVING CONDITIONS – LIVING BETWEEN ORES AND ICE
Author(s): Turck, Rouven (University of Zurich)
Presentation Format: Oral
Last years prehistoric copper mining and copper smelting was explored by university of Zurich in the Oberhalbstein Vallay (Grison,
CH). Several mining galleries and more than 80 melting sites can be detected in mountain environment between 1400 to 2400
masl.
Living conditions of metal working groups in high altitudes must hat been very hard. Less information of food accommodation,
small camps etc. have been found on melting sites. Probably in the lowest parts of the valley around 1400 masl well known settlement of Savognin Padnal was one base for prospecting, mining and melting groups entering the valley. A second settlement
vis-à-vis to Padnal called Motta Vallac will be presented in the paper. It was excavated in the 1970ties, finds and features were
examined by University of Zurich between 2016 and 2018. In addition several Abris in higher altitudes will be presented to illustrate shortly used camps.
Apart from agricultural use of high alpine areas copper ores might have been one tracer to enter such peripheral living spaces.
