THROUGH OBJECT DEPOSITION IN WALES AND SCOTLAND

Wetland archaeological sites have long been interpreted as peripheral or marginal locations. When objects are found within a
wetland context throughout North Western Europe they are assumed to be of a votive nature, without a comprehensive analysis
of cultural practices that would cause such placement within a chosen environment. This project analyses wetland depositional
behaviour and placement of material objects dating to the Iron Age throughout Wales and Scotland in a holistic manner. The
presentation will provide preliminary results from analysis. These results include emerging patterns of object deposition from
the data acquired through museums and private collections or recorded through various digital platforms such as the Treasure
Trove and the Portable Antiquities Scheme. One such example of differing wetland depositional practices for the two regions is
objects placed within a singular and significant location with repeated deposition of a distinct material type in Wales, as opposed
to the sporadic placement of a variety of object types within a common wetland-landscape in Scotland. Therefore, despite preconceived interpretations of wetlands as peripheral, taboo, and at times liminal within prehistory, this paper will argue that they
played a major role in the development of socio-cultural traditions for the two regions that also reflects similar behaviour with
that of the continent.
