the rich sites spread across Denmark, but simultaneously it marks areas void of such patterns.
One such area is Western Jutland adjacent to the North Sea â€“ bordered by the Wadden Sea towards the south and the Limfjord
towards the north. Sparse traces of contemporary occupancy has been located, and attempts at understanding the region entertain narratives that mirrors how Western Jutland is perceived as a national periphery today. Together these narratives form
a regional continuity of marginality through almost 2000 years; even though, adjacency to the North Sea has been placed in
context with upholding aristocratic position through luxury exchanges.
In this paper, I will focus on some of these narratives and investigate their argument and impact on how prehistoric Western
Jutland is understood, and how this corresponds with 1st millennium AD settlement and landscape in this area.
