prehistory, while it also maintained distinctly local characteristics. This session aims to investigate how human groups have
inhabited southern Italian landscapes since prehistory and how they have found local survival strategies within broader demographic, economic, political, and environmental trends. Following Butzer (2005), we look beyond top-down perspectives and
instead put the spotlight on ‘communities as pillars of resilience’ and active agents in terms of adaptation and identity construction.
We present a case study of a bottom-up approach to understanding local communities of the Raganello basin in the Sibaritide
(northern Calabria). The archaeology of this region is traditionally explained from a lowland point of view, with a strong focus on
incipient social complexity and issues of (ethnic) identity in the subcoastal zone during the (pre-)colonial periods. Studies by the
Groningen Institute of Archaeology in the Raganello basin reveal settlement and land use dynamics integrating the lowlands and
the mountainous inlands from the late Neolithic onwards. These observations invite modifications of existing socio-economic
and socio-political models for late prehistoric and historic communities, including complementary explanatory frameworks for
the many small-scale, ephemeral forms of human activity beyond the major sub-coastal settlement centers.
