ANTI-POLITICS: NEUTRALISING INEQUALITY STRUCTURALLY IN PREHISTORIC ITALY

Why was there so little inequality in prehistoric Europe? This paper explores this question, using the Central Mediterranean as a
focus. All societies are reproduced according to a bauplan or set of structuring institutions, technologies and practices. These
parameters set the constraints and limiting factors of the possibility spaces the societies can exist in, as well as the nature
of the exit routes into other modules of historical possibility. Many institutional factors concern peopleâ€™s responses to the development of possible social inequalities. For instance, in hunter-gatherer societies, mobility limits possible social control. The
same is true for the earliest Neolithic societies in much of the Mediterranean; settlements were small, short-lived and fissile. As
Neolithic landscapes filled up, one response was to diffuse leadership into heterarchical ritualism, in which ritual leadership was
unaccompanied by political or economic control. Neolithic Malta illustrates this setting taken to extremes in a circumscribed
setting. Following the structural reorganisation of Mediterranean societies in the later 4th and earlier 3rd millennia BC, the limiting factors were not heterarchy of power sources so much as the fragile nature of hierarchy; an emphasis upon display of wealth
rather than accumulation and kinship as an underpinning for politics inhibited the growth of hierarchy. As this show, throughout
prehistory, structural factors successfully inhibited the growth of entrenched social inequality.
