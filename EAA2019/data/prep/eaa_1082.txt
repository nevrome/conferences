ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE OF CENTRAL SICILY

A significant contribution of recent archaeological discourse concerns the phenomenological landscape, understood as the
symbolic and “political” capability of past and present communities to interact with the environment, determining the development of complex modes of production and reproduction of the material conditions of daily life. The concept of space cannot
exist separate from the events in which it is involved: it is socially produced. A humanized space is therefore both the mean and
the result of cognitive, physical and emotional actions, a social arena constantly in transformation rather than fixed, made up of
different density of human experience. The economic and social marginality that today characterizes the central part of Sicily
as described by the narrative on modern Sicily, hides and denies a past that instead was marked by important social processes.
Recent researches show, in fact, that here early communities, the focus of this paper, were not isolated and scattered in the
desolate heart of the island but, on the contrary, actively participating to the social and cultural dynamics developing across the
Mediterranean. The project for a “political” archeology is thus centered on the knowledge, care and protection of the territory as
a fundamental tool to restore memories and to reconstitute identities. It promotes a conscious use of local resources, producing
new acts of territorialization through shared and participated projects of public archeology, to return cultural and social dignity
to local communities. The landscape is “built” by an entire community and its preservation must be shared by the same people
that have produced it over the generations, and that lives in it every day, even in the paradox of the awareness of distance that
separates from that past and, at the same time, from the perception of its closeness that derives from the frequentation of the
same spaces.
