tinguished by their metal grave goods and also by the positioning of the body in a lateral, flexed position, whereas in the later,
archaic graves the deceased were deposited supine. This change in burial rites seems a clear result of the expansion of Greek
culture throughout the Sibaritide in the 7th and 6th century BC. At the same time, the maintaining of local traditions is expressed
by the close proximity of archaic and earlier burials. The necropolis is therefore a good starting point to examine the construction
of identity in a landscape subjected to deep cultural change in colonial times. Our presentation focuses on the differentiation
between “local” and “global” by investigating continuity and change in the burial traditions of the Macchiabate cemetery from the
8th to the 6th century BC and by analysing the interred individuals using osteoanthropology and isotope analysis.
