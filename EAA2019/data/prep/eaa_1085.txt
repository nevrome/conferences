Presentation Format: Oral
Two geographically and linguistically distinct enclaves Greek in language are currently settled in southern Italy, as a result of cultural and political interactions between this part of the Italian peninsula and Greece extending back for millennia. Among those,
the Calabrian Greek community is currently concentrated in a few villages of the Aspromonte massif, in the southernmost edge
of Calabria.
Despite the increase in attention to the question of the origin of this community and to the changes which have affected this
“language island” over the centuries leading to a sharp decrease in the number of speakers and the progressive decline of this
variety, both in the contexts of academic and popular settings, environmental and topographical factors are still rarely considered as significant issues. This paper outlines the potential of landscape archaeology to contribute to the debate integrating
spatial analysis with semantic and ethnographic data, aiming at a better understanding of this historical phenomenon.
The research concerns the long-term occupational history of this community and explores settlement dynamics and connectivity patterns in the area in a diachronical perspective, looking both at internal and external change agents (such as historical or
climatic events) and comparing local narratives to a larger-scale framework of global trends.
Linking archaeological datasets, glossary, semantic material and place-names, it also investigates subsistence strategies and
changing taskscapes of the local communities and addresses how landscape is represented in the language and what this reveals about the relationships of people to places and land and to their own cultural identity.
