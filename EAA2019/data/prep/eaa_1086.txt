One of the striking characteristics of the Calabro-Lucanian uplands (southern Italy) is the ubiquitous presence of single farmsteads, even in the most remote corners. Some of them are still in use, yet the majority was abandoned in the recent past. These
farms reflect the intensive use of the mountainous inlands for agro-pastoral subsistence by seemingly isolated households.
This paper focuses on the embedding of Early Modern users of this landscape in wider social and economic systems by looking
at mountain mobility and exchange infrastructure. Three levels of mobility are discussed: short-distance movement within a
local taskscape, middle-distance vertical migration, and long-distance trade and transhumance routes. The role of crossroads,
markets, and festivals is explored in terms of risk management and community integration. Early Modern land use strategies and
connectivity provide useful analogies to interpret the late prehistoric archaeological record of the Pollino range, which is investigated since 2006 by landscape archaeological studies of the Groningen Institute of Archaeology. Recent archaeological studies
reveal that the Pollino uplands were affected by human presence from the Neolithic onwards, with increasing environmental
impact from the Middle Bronze Age as recorded in the palynological record. Traditional drove roads and mountain paths across
ridges and passes offer a new perspective on the inland focus of these early inhabitants.
