Research in southern Italian landscapes has traditionally distinguished between periods where settlements were focused substantially on the coast, and those which focused more on upland areas, contrasting the societies within them and especially their
connections with the wider Mediterranean world and beyond. We argue that largely unacknowledged underlying assumptions
about the normality of coastal settlement are deeply embedded in most of the relevant scholarly literature. This has distorted
how scholars have valued and evaluated different periods in relation to each other, and thus how trajectories of ascent, growth
and decline, or connectedness versus isolation, have been identified and defined in relation to particular societies. We suggest
that a perspective which takes as its starting point the normality of upland settlement, identifying coastal settlement as a
comparatively extraordinary phenomenon, enables us to build a completely different kind of long-term history of southern Italian landscapes. This approach demonstrates that although the more upland-oriented societies characteristic of some periods
operated differently from the more coastal-oriented societies of other periods, connectivity as well as political and economic
