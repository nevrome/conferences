The transition to farming was a vital step in establishing modern societies. A critical component of this step was the cultivation
of food plants, which led to a sharp increase in the successful subsistence of sedentary populations. At the foundation of the
sedentary societies’ structure were critical food crops; the earliest of these are called `founder crops’ due to the essential status they had in the diet as hunter-gatherers transitioned to an agrarian society.
Faba bean, as a protein-rich food, might have served as a valuable meat substitute for early farmers as they transitioned from
hunting large game to agrarian sustenance, but it is has never being included among the founder crops.
Until recently, the original area of distribution of the legume was unknown and the legume went unnoticed.
New discoveries in Southern Levant proved the pivotal role of the plant among the earliest farmers of the region and solved the
enigma of the faba bean’s origins.
The present study is based on the survey of the findings of faba bean in archaeological sites, where the seeds can be preserved
for thousands of years, and aims to identify the original distribution of the wild progenitor of faba bean and the routes used by
prehistoric farmers to spread the domesticated types across the Mediterranean.
The data collected show that the wild progenitor grew on Mount Carmel (Israel) about 14,000 years ago and that the earliest
domesticated types were cultivated in Lower Galilee (Israel) around 10,200 years ago. From this point onward, remains of faba
bean started appearing in the Middle East, then in the Mediterranean, and later, in central Europe, following the dispersal routes
of the Neolithic farmers.
