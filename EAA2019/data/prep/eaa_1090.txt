UPPER PALAEOLITHIC TO THE PRESENT

The field of Cultural Astronomy is closely related to three disciplines (cultural anthropology, ethnohistory, and archaeology) and
retrieves its data utilizing techniques and methods drawn from each field. At this juncture, it is important for Cultural Astronomy
to develop a rigorous methodology capable of integrating these three types of evidence. The interdisciplinary nature of Cultural
Astronomy, the study of astronomy in culture, has been recognized as advantageous by those scholars who have been dissatisfied with the dominant paradigm of modern Western science which divides knowledge into smaller and smaller disciplines. This
new area of study reflects the desire to promote interdisciplinary initiatives that, in turn, can promote cooperation between
those working in different fields. When approaching the question of how patterns of a peopleâ€™s preterit worldview can be studied,
feedback is elicited from archaeological remains combined with relevant ethnohistorical evidence and insights drawn from cultural anthropology. This approach serves as a means of reconstructing cultural knowledge systems in prehistory, albeit always
hypothetically, showing how interactions with the environment served to shape the way that skyscape and landscape resources
were melded into an overarching worldview, in this case, one associated with bear ceremonialism. Debates over the evidence for
the existence of a bear cult during the Upper Paleolithic have gone on for years along with the question of whether survivals of
the archaic cosmology associated with historically attested examples of circumpolar bear ceremonialism among hunter-gatherers can be used as proxies for reconstructing this earlier worldview and the skyscape that might have been projected as part
of it. In this talk cross-cultural comparisons, supplemented by archaeological evidence, will be used to explore the question of
how in times past landscape and skyscape might have been fused through recourse to an animistic belief system centered on
bear ancestors.
