rington Walls is the companion doppelgänger to the ‘stone’ Stonehenge. Since Parker Pearson suggests that this model also
applies to the Avebury monument complex, then his materiality model is amenable to test through the details of the companion ‘stone’ Avebury Circle and ‘wood’ West Kennet Palisades. Since Parker Pearson’s model invests lunar-solar alignments to
Stonehenge and Durrington Walls, by extension, we would expect a matching ‘astronomy’ at the Avebury monuments. Recently
three independent archaeoastronomy researchers have found a dual ritual syntax in late Neolithic/EBA monument alignments
in three different regions of the British Isles. Higginbottom for the West of Scotland and Fisher for the south Wales Prescelli
Hills both suggest that paired monuments are located in orthogonally-aligned landscapes for reversed alignments in alternating
rituals. Sims suggests that Stonehenge similarly exhibits reversed ‘astronomical’ and landscape properties but also in diacritical combinations associated with reversed materialities. These precise overlapping design details at Stonehenge across three
dimensions – archaeology, landscape and archaeoastronomy - radically reduce the number of plausible interpretations, and suggest that no ritual at one particular monument can be complete without moving on, from pillar to post, to its paired companion
monument in a ceaseless alternation. A detailed examination at Avebury of the archaeology and archaeoastronomy of the West
Kennet Palisades allows a test for this expectation of inter-disciplinary convergence.
