Jetsu, Porceddu et al. published between 2008 and 2016 a series of articles in prestigious journals (Cambridge Archaeological
Journal 2008; The Astrophysical Journal 2013; Plos One 2015; Open astronomy 2018) arguing that the ancient Egyptians noticed the variability of Algol. The document on which they base their study is a kind of almanac from the 13th cen. BC with prognoses for a lucky or unlucky course of events during an Egyptian civil year, each day divided into three parts with its own prognosis.
The authors expressed the sequence of prognoses as a series of time points and checked with the Rayleigh test whether the
points are randomly distributed or show periodicity. They found a period which is apparently lunar, but also a period of 2.85 days
which they explain as corresponding to the period of Algol’s change in brightness.
Any reference to Algol would create a serious Egyptological problem. Very few stars which are mentioned in ancient Egyptian
sources are identifiable and Algol is not one of them. Considering that the variability of Algol was first recognized in 1669 it would
be somewhere between beyond belief and marvellous should the ancient Egyptians had monitored Algol’s variability closely and
furthermore used the results as basis for prognostication of good or bad luck in every day life. Under these circumstances one
may ask whether there is a flaw in the argument of Jetsu et al. Assuming that the Rayleigh test has been employed faultlessly,
the question is whether the basic data – i.e. the expression of the series of prognoses as series of time points – is error free. This
question is the subject of the suggested paper.
