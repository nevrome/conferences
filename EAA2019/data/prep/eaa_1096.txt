interpretation but can inform the study of astral presence in the art. Academic discourse in the field of rock art studies centred
on formal iconographical elements of San cosmological celestial phenomena, such as stars and the moon, is enhanced by my
formal assessment motivated through an art historical approach, which uncovers attributes of celestial bodies with a particular
focus on the correlative interchange through colour. One such celestial phenomenon available through the ethnographic archive
with explicit colour reference is the San concept of the rainbow. This paper explores this notion in the archive and its potential
resonance to a multi-coloured painted motif at the ‘rainbow mystery shelter’ in the Cederberg, Western Cape, South Africa,
along with potential astrological representations of lunar and solar halos. At the intersection of ethnography, science and art, I
examine the plausibility of the ‘inverted rainbow’ or circumzenithal arc, as a pictorial motif with attendant cultural associations
to weather. The atmospheric phenomenon of the circumzenithal arc as a meteorological weather event indicating an oncoming
pressure system bringing precipitation has analogical resonance to San cosmological metaphors for rain and fertility. The creative underpinnings of a discursive aesthetic in San rock art may hold true for other colour-related terms and the impact pictorially
may extend current methods available in Cultural Astronomy.
