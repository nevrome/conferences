Over the last thirty years we have developed an increasingly heightened sense of the ownership and use of horses in the long
11th century. The main evidence base which has contributed to this new knowledge is an archaeological one, with an influx of
new material at our disposal over the same period. The majority of the new material constitutes non-ferrous metalwork discovered through metal-detecting in rural areas, and as such previously underrepresented through conventional archaeological
investigation.
This paper aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for equestrianism in the long 11th-century, taking an international approach. Since metal-detected evidence can only play a part when it has been recorded by responsible finders there will
be a natural focus on areas where recording schemes for metal-detected finds have been in operation: England, the Low Countries and Denmark. Having explored the various supra-national connections and differences between the surviving components
of equestrian equipment, we will attempt to assess the relative social standing of equestrianism in our North Sea case study
areas. It is hoped that by taking a wide view of horse ownership and use in the 11th century that a more nuanced sense of its
political and social function can be provided for a given country or region.
