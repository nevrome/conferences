describe tombs aggregated in dense or dispersed clusters. This approach recognises the likely ceremonial role and extended
meaning for all such monuments in the lives and belief systems of the societies who erected them. In that context, this paper
further considers the pronounced and striking preference for siting most Irish passage tombs on locally elevated ground, and on
the summits of prominent hilltops and mountains. Data analysis suggests an intent to achieve visibility, dominance and power
by exploiting topographical height in an elevation and symbolic sense. Such site selection enforces collective community ascent and descent through tiered cosmic levels as part of the religious ritual of death, burial and the journey of the spirit into the
otherworld. If height was an important element of tomb ontology, the methodologies and perspectives of cultural astronomy
are a potentially powerful contributory tool to explore a range of relevant research questions. For example, is there linkage between the liminality of the horizon visible from tombs and observable solar rising or setting phenomena occurring at seasonally
important times? Does the elevated siting of tombs indicate a preference for visibility of the distant horizon sector delimited by
the northern solstitial limits of the rising and setting sun? Was the northern dark sky and skyscape perceived as a portal to an
otherworld in the journey of the dead?
