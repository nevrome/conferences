Presentation Format: Oral
The most characteristic and famous artefact of the Vučedol culture is the calendar pot found at the Croatian town Vinkovci. Although the vessel is incomplete, the structure of its ornamentation can be well observed. The surface is divided into four parallel
horizontal zones which are also broken down into panels by vertical double lines. Every other panel contains a motif/symbol periodically used. Alexandar Durman argues that this ornamentation on the pot represents a stellar calendar. The horizontal zones
stand for the seasons. The different signs of a zone denote constellations which were seasonal indications for Vučedol people.
These symbols play a significant role in the ornamental art of the Classical Phase.
In contrast, the author argues that the ornamental symbols of the pot show similarities with the abstract motifs on the gaming
boards of the Royal Game of Ur dated to 2600 – 2400 BCE. Therefore, the use of these symbols is not constricted exclusively to
the Vučedol culture and might play roles in divination. The comparative investigation of the symbols indicates strong intercultural relations with Eastern Mediterranean.
