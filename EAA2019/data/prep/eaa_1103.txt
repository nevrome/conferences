Presentation Format: Oral
The Maltese Archipelago has some of the world’s most unique prehistoric megalithic monuments, often referred to as ‘temples’,
chronologically dated to Late Neolithic Malta, also known as the Maltese Temple Period (3,600 BCE -2,500 BCE). Their architectural and spatial structure, iconography, material culture and positioning in the cultural landscape have been extensively
explored by archaeologists. However, archaeological research has rarely considered the sky as a cultural resource available to
the prehistoric society who built and used these structures.
