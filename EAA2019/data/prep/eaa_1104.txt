The monuments have also been studied by both astronomers and archaeoastronomers though largely concerned with astronomical alignments and celestial bodies, often neglecting the wider archaeological record and the human element in cosmology.
Despite the shared goals, the two interdisciplinary fields (archaeology and archaeoastronomy) have studied the paradigm of the
Maltese prehistoric cosmology mainly in isolation.
Seeking a new understanding of these issues by using new methodologies to extend the works of previous scholars, this presentation shall argue that the Late Neolithic Mnajdra Temple in Malta was built to reflect, if not entirely at least partially, a cosmology that can be studied through Skyscape Archaeology.
