The site Ostrov-2 was found and studied on the eastern side of the Urals. It cavers chronological period of the beginning of the IV
century BC. Forty pits were localized by two circles. Two pits in the center consisted remains of cut head of 7-8 years child, the
18 years woman bones, the scraper and the blade, 4-5 years child skull and the pebble. Other 38 pits rounded human remains.
The line «north-south» has marked evidently, the step of hole-pits has been 2-2,5 meters in the inner circle, in the outside circle
we haven’t stereotypic step size. Four lines painted from the center through pits marked directions to the sunset in summer and
winter solstice, sunrise in winter and summer solstice. Eight lines give the directions to the different phases of the Low and High
Moon. Half of pits had subjects: flakes, head of arrow, tools on the blades, cores. Pottery of Shapkul’ culture belongs to egg-form
vessels with decoration of horizontal and vertical belts of combed.
So, the site Ostrov-2 is a woodhenge and place of ritual actions, may be, burial cult which was accompanied by astronomic observations. The rituals with using of skulls are known on the Urals and Siberian sites of Stone age. We interpret that actions with
skulls as connected with cult of ancestors and cult of fertility.
