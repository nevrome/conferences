LORD, WHAT FOOLS THESE MORTALS BE! EUROPEAN ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE PAST, THE PRESENT AND
THE FUTURE

Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeologists tend to worry. And the result of the Brexit referendum and the following developments have not been appreciated
by the lion share of those among us who are interested in a transnational Archaeology. In (mock?) despair we call those who want
to create the new divide: “Fools.” Although, many of us claim to react rationally, if we are honest with ourselves it is in a large part
an emotional reflex.
We can be captured by the trend, uncertainty or our ‘despair. ’ But lets not; and seize this moment to look at the early development of European Archaeology. Some accidents and miracles. What we have and share and put that against the needs of the
communities (including ours) and society in our shared part of the world. Let’s be Fools and swim against the stream. There is
wisdom in that choice. This contribution hopes to inspire and show that the new divide will only become reality if we let it. There
is enough to do in our common Future that warrants maintaining close ties.
