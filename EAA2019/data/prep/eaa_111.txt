Presentation Format: Oral
The timeframe of the initial intensive cultivation of both grapes and olives in Europe is a cornerstone of a long standing debate.
It is suggested in the ‘Mediterranean polyculture’ hypothesis (Barrett & Halstead 2004; Renfrew 2011 for extensive discussion)
that Neolithic subsistence agriculture was based on the cultivation of cereals and pulses, and the use of livestock. In the 3rd
millennium BC, however, the systematic exploitation of the olive and the vine transformed traditional Neolithic subsistence:
the new species could be grown on marginal land, where even poor, previously uncultivated soils could now be exploited. This
development could be characterised as a separate agricultural revolution in southern Europe; the cultivation of the vine and the
olive led to the production of a surplus, and their secondary products, wine and olive oil, were transformed into valuable commodities, retaining their central place in the economy of European societies until today. These transformations were correlated with
population growth and with changes in technology and exchange patterns. For Renfrew and others (Renfrew 2011 for a review),
the olive and vine therefore played a fundamental role in the creation of the conditions for the emergence of the first state-level
complex societies of Europe, the palaces of the Minoan and Mycenaean societies of the 2nd millennium BC. Other researchers
(Hamilakis 1996 for a review), however, suggest that these very important economic and social developments did not start during the 3rd millennium but, instead, they took place at least a millennium later. This debate is still ongoing in European prehistory
because of the paucity of the archaeological, and in particular the archaeobotanical, evidence. This paper will examine the role of
the olive and grape in Prehistoric Aegean though the analysis of archaeobotanical remains, morphometric analysis and material
culture.
