Presentation Format: Oral
The paper will outline the mission and function of the Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland as per its Three Year Strategic Plan.
The Membership base of IAI, has as one of its greatest strength, diversity of Members in all sectors of the profession across two
legislative jurisdictions on the island of Ireland.
The political border on the island of Ireland for the last twenty years has been crossed effortlessly by archaeologists in a two-way
flow of those seeking employment in the profession and delivering tendered contracts. This was a significant factor in the successful delivery of development projects in the Republic of Ireland in the 1990’s up to the mid 2000’s. As the Republic of Ireland
reaches closer to full employment and a forecast increasing demand for archaeologists, we have IAI Members whose project
load covers the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain. The uncertainty of movement and employment caused by Brexit
will unfold over time and will be tracked in this paper.
But the flows for the archaeological profession do not solely reflect archaeological personnel, it is also the flow of archaeological
material, where under export licencing legislation, some samples are sent to Northern Ireland and Britain for processing. A new
regulatory mechanism raises practical and financial concerns for the archaeological profession.
A large cohort of our Members are employed in research and teaching in the University sector. Funding for partnered research
projects at an EU level is uncertain at the time of writing this submission.
