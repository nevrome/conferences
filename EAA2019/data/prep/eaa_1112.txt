BREXIT – SO NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
Author(s): Hinton, Peter (Chartered Institute for Archaeologists)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper, like the UK parliament, is divided on Brexit.
Half of the presentation will be from CIfA, presenting its most recent analysis of the potential impacts of what has happened,
and what CIfA has been doing to mitigate the damage that might be done and to capitalise on the few potential opportunities.
Concerns relate to changes of UK legislation affecting archaeology and the ability of European archaeologists to work across
the EU/UK border.
Half of it will be personal, reflecting on how we got here, and what we, as individuals and European organisations could do about
it. And what we should do about it. And – if discussion goes well – we might even decide what we will do about it.
So a paper of two halves: one seeks to be reasoned, informed and moderate; the other will be illogical, unfounded and emotional.
That seems to be the pattern for this issue.
