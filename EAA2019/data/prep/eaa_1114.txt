In order to better understand mobility patterns in Neolithic societies of the Northern Alpine Foreland pottery of simultaneous
lake dwelling settlements was studied by combining stylistic analyses with characterisations of the potter’s clay used.
To characterise the ceramics different methods were combined: macroscopic grouping, chemical analysis by portable ed-XRF as
well as petrographic on thin sections and mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The latter supported the interpretation of the chemical results.
