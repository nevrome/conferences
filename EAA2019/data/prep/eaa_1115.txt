Since studies on the use of pXRF to investigate handmade, heterogeneous and coarsely tempered ceramics are rare so far, the
usefulness of pXRF to characterise this kind of pottery has been evaluated. In order to obtain quantitative, meaningful results,
an analysis strategy was developed in which both the effort and the results are in good proportion to each other. Additionally, a
sample of the ceramics analysed with pXRF was checked with laboratory wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF).
The comparison of pottery deriving from settlements of different locations shows the potential information that can be gained
from a combination of pXRF and stylistic analyses to identify mobility patterns in Neolithic societies.
The limitations to pXRF analyses in the area under study are shown when attempting to differentiate between potterâ€™s clays
from regions with similar geological conditions to study small-scale mobility: This pottery can only tentatively be distinguished.
A comparison between pXRF and laboratory WD-XRF data shows that in this case the poor distinction is less method-related but,
rather, caused by the very similar geological conditions and materials available.
