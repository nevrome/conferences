obtained on two stationary ED-XRF systems.
Two questions are asked, and tentatively answered: is pXRF currently up to the task as specified, and how does is perform compared to older, stationary systems?
Samples analysed were :
a) Nabataean fine and common ware from the Nabatean capital, Petra (Jordan) (Swiss-Liechtenstein excavations at the habitation quarters on az-Zantur, Petra; University of Basel, Switzerland).
b) Nabataean fine ware samples found in the Nabatean border settlement Hegra (Saudi Arabia), distant some 500 km from Petra
(French-Saudi excavations in Hegra; CNRS – Orient et Méditerranée; University of Paris 1, France; and University of Hâ’il, Saudi
Arabia).
The author worked as ceramologist on both excavations. The samples from Petra are known to be produced locally. For the Hegra
samples, the question was: local or imported? A preliminary provenance hypothesis based on typology was tested.
Petra samples had been previously analysed by the author on two different ED-XRF systems. Those measurements served as
reference. They were analysed again, in pXRF, together with the Hegra samples. A statistical analysis of the resulting chemical
classification and its typo-chronological correspondence is presented. A-priori and a-posteriori attributions are confronted. Reproducibility, accuracy, precision and practicality of current pXRF for this kind of analysis are critically assessed.
