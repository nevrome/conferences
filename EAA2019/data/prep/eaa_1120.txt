The Rokštejn Castle pottery assemblages span from the 13th to the 15th century, encompassing the existence of the Castle
from its origins until the destruction in 1467. Based on the data from the systematic archaeological excavation of the Castle. The
main parts pottery is of the inner castle moat, and stratified pottery assemblages are precisely dated. Pottery assemblages for
comparison come from settlements of the primary hinterland (castle fiefdom) and are approximately 75 years older than from
the castle itself. The samples also cover Early Modern Period pottery (excavation at Panská Lhota No. 31). The aim of this presentation is to discuss the development of pottery in the castle and village environments as a social aspect of local production
and/or trade with pottery. The study of the provenance of the pottery (pXRF and macroscopic analyses) is an ongoing project
focused mainly on the area of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, where the castle and its hinterland are situated.
