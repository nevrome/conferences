Sourcing artifacts of obsidian, a volcanic and homogeneous lithic material which comes from a limited number of potential
sources, has been successful since the 1970s using analytical instruments including X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis, and since the late 1980s laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry. Starting in the mid-2000s, the ability to conduct
nondestructive analyses within museums using portable XRF instruments has revolutionized the number of obsidian artifacts
tested and produced large statistically significant datasets allowing comparisons in trade and distribution between sites and
regions and over time.
Pottery production and trade studies using these three analytical instruments goes back many decades, while the number of artifacts in analytical studies has increased tremendously with the widespread availability of portable XRF spectrometers. Nevertheless, the existence of clay deposits over great distances along rivers, and the compositional alteration in ceramic production
due to adding temper, potentially mixing clays, and having burnished, slipped, or glazed surfaces has always limited the precision
