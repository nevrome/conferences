of geological source attribution and socioeconomic distribution and trade interpretation, especially when nondestructive surface analyses are conducted.
Over the past 12 years, more than 17,000 obsidian and ceramic artifacts were analyzed using three models of a portable XRF
spectrometer that developed over that time. While the increased number of measurable elements and better detection limits
of the most recent versions of pXRFs has not made a big impact on obsidian sourcing studies, it clearly has for pottery analyses.
Obtaining results while using a vacuum on all of the major elements, and on more trace elements than before with detection limits
in single digit ppm, can definitely indicate when ceramic artifacts are non-local, and the use of appropriate calibration software
enables comparison with published data for other sites and regions. Examples from studies in the central Mediterranean will be
presented.
