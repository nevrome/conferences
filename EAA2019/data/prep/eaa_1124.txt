“In this presentation the microfacies and pXRF analyses for the identification of silicite sources of archeological artefacts are
compared. Microfacies analyses is a proved nondestructive geological method. pXRF is as completely non-destructive alternative for investigation of the fingerprint of archeologic artefacts and could be used for linking the artefact found in an archeologic
site to the outcrop where it was gathered.
The main issues that are addressed by the ongoing research are: Is pXRF a valid investigation method for silicites? Does the very
high Silicium content hinder the detection of elements which are present in low concentrations? Are the inhomogeneities within
the same piece smaller than between pieces of different origin? Can the measuring mode or protocol be improved?
The archaeological artefacts analysed, stem of dryland sites from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic time in western Ukraine and of
a Neolithic wetland site in Switzerland. Because of the environmental difference in the storage conditions of the artefacts we
can furthermore test if the applicability of the pXRF method is depending on environmental conditions of archaeological sites.”
