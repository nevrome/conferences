A major research question in the study of prehistoric Europe is the analysis of traded items - for example, amber, variscite, ivory
… - and their implications for understanding social interaction dynamics. Exchange theories developed since the mid 1970’s
have been successful in developing this avenue of research. Rare minerals as variscite offer an excellent opportunity to study
trade and exchange patterns in prehistoric Europe.
Green beads exchange has been for long understood as a key feature of long distance exchange. Recent studies have point to
some key elements or element ratios as the clue to define exchange flows. In this comunication, we review all the approaches to
variscite provenance cross validating them with a dataset of c. 500 XRD, portable XRF and NMR analysis of the 4 Iberian known
outcrops and green bead’s assemblages coming from 10 sites coeval to the mines exploitation. We specially focus on the use
of portable XRF devices.
This opens pathways to think about how production and consumption is organized in a global scale, as in the case of jade, ‘imitations’ or more ‘mundane’ raw materials are being used near production areas and the more valued material is being long distance
traded. To this particular is very interesting to think about the role of the communities that mined, transformes and traded this
valued raw materials.
