METALWORKING

Today XRF analyses are widely used for the determination of the base elemental composition of ancient metals and alloys. Nevertheless, each archaeological collection creates a unique context for the interpretation of the obtained analytical data. This
paper presents the first characterization of non-ferrous metalworking in ancient Khorezm (Chorasmia). The study is based on
the compositional analysis by X-ray fluorescence (including pXRF) of a large series of metal objects from Khorezm, a river oasis
region in the Amu Darya delta in western Central Asia (modern Uzbekistan). The metal artefacts analyzed date from the 7th century BC to the 5th century AD. Because there are no metal ore deposits in this region, all raw materials had to be imported. The
obtained analytical data show a very wide and disparate range of metals and alloys used in Khorezmian workshops which suggest
a variety of sources of raw materials. Combining an analytical study of the data with the archaeological evidence provides new
insights into metal production in the Khorezmian oasis, and into the trade in metals in a wider Central Asian context.
