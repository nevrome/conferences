Faster and cheaper methods allow us to increase the amount of samples from archaeological excavations and materials which
can be processed in a cost-efficient way. Here, we present the use of a handheld (x-ray fluorescence) pXRF for the laboratory
analysis of bulk sediment samples from an activity layer excavated inside a 9th-century CE market place house in the emporium
of Ribe, Denmark.
The house was sampled during the Northern Emporium Project excavation (2017-2018) in a closely spaced grid of 0.25 x 0.25 m
(a total of 1108 samples), which allowed us to sample approximately half of the surface area of the house. This high-resolution
sampling strategy poses an opportunity to obtain a better understanding of the use of indoor space at this early point of urbanism in the Viking world.
A high spatial resolution data set such as the one created here makes it possible to 1) include a thorough statistical analysis on
the use of pXRF for this type of study, 2) examine how more traditional, coarser sample spacing can influence interpretations,
and 3) potentially create better archeological evidence of different activity areas within this house when combined with the
excavation results and other scientific analyses. In this paper we will present the first results and on this basis discuss new
methodological considerations for sampling soils from archaeological settlement contexts.
