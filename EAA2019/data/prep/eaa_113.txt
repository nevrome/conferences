Most oil and fibre plants receive less attention from archaeobotanists than cereals and pulses, with the exception of flaxseed
(Linum usitatissimum). Among the fibre plants used in Prehistory one should include the nettle (Urtica dioica). Regarding oil
plants, there is evidence of poppy (Papaver somniferum), false flax (Camelina sativa) and also non-domesticated species such
as turnip (Brassica rapa), woolly distaff thistle (Carthamus lanatus) and milk thistle (Silybum marianum). All of these plants rarely
appear in discussions on Prehistoric plant use, even though they are present in the taxa lists of some archaeobotanically investigated sites.
For each of the species we will discuss which criteria, if any, are used to distinguish the wild form from the domestic plant, we will
reflect on their potential as cultivated plants, and we will focus on their use and how we can assess it in the prehistoric record.
Given the limited archaeological evidence available, we will review ethnographic records. Finally, we will look at their presence in
the archaeobotanical record in Neolithic Europe, focussing on the North-west Mediterranean area and the North Alps, based on
the archaeobonical data (seed and fruit) compilation done within the SNF-Funded AgriChange Project (PP00P1_170515). We will
also discuss their absence in the archaeobotanical record as a result of taxonomic and sampling problems.
The aim of this presentation is to challenge the audience’s conception of agricultural diversity and wild plant use among early
farmers in the Neolithic period, integrating a set of plants that cover essential human needs but are rarely included in large reviews.
