P-XRF MEASUREMENTS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL PIGMENTS

Presentation Format: Poster
The pigments found in archaeological sites consist mainly of iron derivatives or compounds for yellow, red or brown colours, of
coal for black and grey colours and of chalk for white colours. We shall limit ourselves here to the first category, whose components react better to X-ray fluorescence spectrometry analyses. This type of analysis, common in geology, is still not widely applied for the study of ochre in archaeology (Hodgkiss et Wadley 2017). This may be due to the fact that a powder is usually made
of the sample to be analysed before it is measured. The arrival of portable measuring devices (p-xrf), which allow the sample to be
measured directly on its surface, makes it possible to remedy this situation and therefore seems very promising for archaeology.
In order to identify the potential applications of this device for pigment studies, a series of archaeological samples from Swiss
Young Palaeolithic sites were analysed simultaneously with a batch of samples corresponding to the potential sources of these
archaeological finds based on macroscopic and stereomicroscopic examination. The results will be presented and discussed
during this communication, in order to define the possible journey of the ochre parallel to the known flint routes.
