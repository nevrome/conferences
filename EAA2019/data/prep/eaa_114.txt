Common oat belongs to the Avena genus, which comprises around 25 annual species. Several species of oat have been domesticated, but only one species – Avena sativa, common oat – has prevailed as an important cereal. Before domestication, wild oats
were gathered and used in several regions. Pre-domestication cultivation of oat has been recorded at several sites, including Palaeolithic Gilgal, Israel, while grinding tools in Palaeolithic Israel and Italy have produced evidence for starch grains of wild oat on
their surfaces, suggesting the tools were used to create oat flour. Domestication of cereals such as wheat and barley occurred
during the Neolithic period, but domestication of common oat occurred much later, probably in later prehistory. Resolution of the
timing and location(s) of oat domestication has proved rather challenging, but it is suspected that oat was domesticated in Europe. This paper will examine archaeobotanical evidence for the domestication and spread of oat in Europe, focusing on spatial,
temporal and grain-measurement data.
