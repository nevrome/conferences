The long stratigraphic sequence from the site of Jordan River Dureijat (JRD) in northern Israel covers the entire span of the
Levantine Epipaleolithic (EP; c. 23-11.5 KY BP). The three upper layers of the sequence belong to the Final EP Natufian culture,
while Layer 4 contains a Geometric Kebaran lithic industry. The lower part of the sequence is Early EP Kebaran. Evidence for
fishing activity was found in all archaeological layers. Bone fishing hooks and small limestone and basalt line weights derive from
the Natufian layers, and limestone elongated cobbles were present throughout the entire sequence. The size and standardised
morphology of the limestone cobbles suggest that they were collected and transported to the site over the course of thousands
of years.
