Here we present a techno-functional analysis of the lithic and bone artefacts from JRD. The small line weights and fishing hooks
were analysed using low and high magnification microscopes. We also studied ethnographic fishing equipment to better understand production methods and use. In addition, a sample of the limestone elongated cobbles from JRD was analysed microscopically. Preliminary results suggest that they were functioning as net sinkers.
The analysis of the small weights and fishing hooks provide new insights into production techniques and the methods, duration
and efficiency of use by the EP fishers from the site. The results support the interpretation that the archaeological layers from
JRD document thousands of years of fishing as part of repeated short term visits by EP hunter-gatherers groups to the shores
of the Paleo-Hula Lake.
