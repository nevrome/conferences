Maritime hunter-gatherer societies have been traditionally considered by archaeologists as a subset of hunter-gatherer groups
specialized in the exploitation of coastal biotopes. It has been proposed that this economical specialization requires a very precise degree of technology to obtain those specific resources (Yesner, 1980; Kelly, 2007). Fishing, shellfish gathering and sailing
are well documented in the archaeological record of maritime hunter-gatherer populations from the European fringe during the
Holocene. However, due to the differential preservation of archaeological data, the techniques and technical traditions behind
those maritime activities are not always well understood.
The Late Mesolithic knapped industries in Brittany, also known as Téviecien, appear to provide a suitable basis to address these
questions. For example, the shell-middens of Beg-er-Vil (Morbihan, France) and Beg-an-Dorchenn (Finistère, France) have delivered numerous artefacts from knapped industries, not only finished tools (such as truncated blades and bladelets, scrapers or
trapezoidal bitruncations), but also a large number of unretouched products.
Through the use-wear study of very large samples of retouched and unretouched industries, combining micro and macro usewear methodology and experimental data to understand the functionality of these lithic tools, some preliminary hypotheses can
be proposed. For example, the very widespread range of activities documented in this study and the low intensity level of use of
the tools provide some new clues to better understand the technical traditions of the maritime hunter-gatherers populations.
