In this paper, we would like to explore projectile technology during the Early Upper Paleolithic in the Japanese islands by analyzing edge damage and use-related fracture velocity on trapezoids. Trapezoids are a major formal flaked tool in the Early Upper
Paleolithic and are thought to be used by the first modern human groups that migrated into the Japanese islands. A series of
experiments using replicated trapezoids were conducted to investigate the relationship between the velocity of impact fracture
and the projectile delivery modes (arrows, spearthrower darts, javelins, and spears). To measure use-related fracture velocity,
this paper focuses on the fracure wings which are microscopic markings found on the fracture surfaces. We present the results
of analyses of fracture wings observed on trapezoids from the several Early Upper Paleolithic sites, such as Doteue, Kojou, Hinatabayashi-B in central Japan. The results of analyses demonstrate that the Early Upper Paleolithic trapezoids were delivered
mechanically. This may provide us with an important insight into the behavioral strategy and technology of the first modern
human groups that migrated into the Japanese islands.
