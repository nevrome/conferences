Mesolithic structures, identified through post holes, hollows and hearths, can provide rare glimpses into the daily lives of hunter-gatherers who are often associated with short-lived occupation and nomadic lifestyles. During recent excavations at the
world-renowned Early Mesolithic site of Star Carr, North Yorkshire (UK), nearly 25,000 flints were found and at least three structures were identified. As a result of a multi-disciplinary analysis, it was possible to observe distinctions in tool-based activities
within the concentrations of flint excavated from across the site; evidence of craftwork, including plant working, flint axe manufacturing and repair, hide and, antler processing, as well as butchery and fish processing are just some of the activities identified
to date.
An initial microwear pilot study of the structures indicates retooling and clearance as well as opportunistic, small-scale craft
activities, sometimes on recycled projectiles: thus challenging traditional typo-functional models. The microwear results further suggest that there are possible distinctions in tool-based activities undertaken in and around the structures. However, the
full extent and nature of these activities remains unknown, and it is still unclear how tool-using activities within the structures
relates to those found across the site.
A more extensive sample of flint from inside the structures is being analysed to unpick and characterise the small-scale craft
activities being undertaken in the structures. As a result, the social dimensions of tool use areas at Star Carr will be examined
and the potential to gain new insights into the lives of hunter-gatherers who inhabited the site will be discussed. It is hoped that
this research will add to discourse regarding the importance of implementing functional analysis of lithics, whilst exploring the
social significance of structures within the context of the British Mesolithic and in Mesolithic Europe.
