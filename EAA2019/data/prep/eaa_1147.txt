Formal functional analyses of early Upper Paleolithic assemblages have remained limited partly due to a dearth of newly excavated sites appropriate for analysis and the lack of appropriate methods for study. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by
presenting the results of a techno-typological analysis combined with use wear analysis of 346 lithic artifacts from the recently
excavated Aurignacian assemblage from the large, stratified open-air site of Româneşti-Dumbrăviţa in southeastern Romania.
This site is located close to (c. 90 km), and is contemporaneous with, the oldest modern human fossils in Europe. Combined
with geochemical analyses, we show that the Aurignacian assemblage of Româneşti-Dumbrăviţa demonstrates good use-wear
preservation on unburned pieces, with part of the assemblage demonstrating some form of functional evidence. These results
contribute to a better understanding of both artifact techno-typologies in the early Upper Paleolithic and provides evidence of
how the earliest modern humans in Europe subsisted in new ecosystems.
