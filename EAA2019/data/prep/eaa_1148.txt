Eastern Sicily territory shows a high variety of ecological, geological and geographical units. Prosperous wild fauna and wild
vegetation were and still are, despite the lacking in the recent past of a smart ecological policy, key attractive characteristics to
drive the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunter and gatherer groups towards places with resources. Are we able to deal in trying
to reconstruct the broader spectrum of resource these people processed through lithic tools? When analysing lithic surfaces,
it is common to meet with absent, unpreserved or undeveloped micro-wear / macro-wear traces. Sometime the poor presence/
development of wear might be related to lack or short use, or maybe to a highly skilled user (?), or to the petrographic characteristics of lithic raw materials or to the structure and composition of worked materials.This work contributes through an assessing
of traceological methodologies, traditional and third-millennium ones to to a deeper understanding of past hunters-gatherers
behaviour bringing the lithic implements into contact with the contexts under analysis. Wear traces observed on flint assemblage from eastern Sicily Mesolithic and Upper Paleolithic sites, among which rock shelter of Sperlinga S. Basilio, located on the
Peloritani mountains, Corruggi Cave which is located nearby the coastland and Giovanna Cave, located not far from seaside and
closer to the Hyblaean Mountains, will be here discussed together with the adopted analytical strategies.
