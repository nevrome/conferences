Evidence for the presence of apple (Malus sp.) in Prehistoric Europe is archaeobotanically detected since the Mesolithic period.
In a recent review of the data we observed that Neolithic finds increase radically while they drop again in the Bronze and Iron
Ages, finally increasing again afterwards, with the arrival of the domesticated species. Is this truly so in different regions of Europe? And what does it mean from an economic point of view? Was crab apple fostered and managed in the Neolithic period and
largely abandoned (or kept at a smaller scale) afterwards?
In order to go deeper into this discussion we will present an overview of apple finds in different regions of Europe where evidence
is found over long chronological sequences and jointly discuss both taphonomic aspects (including methodological biases) as
well as palaeoeconomic implications of the data. Our results will also be compared to current observations on crab apple productivity.
