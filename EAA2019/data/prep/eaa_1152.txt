residence groups and the ethnic interpretation of ‘archaeological cultures’ fostered ideas of static and homogeneous social
entities with fixed borders. Farming – the core of the Neolithic way of life – was associated with sedentariness rather than with
mobility. Furthermore, the widely used (neo-)evolutionist thinking assumed a universally growing social hierarchization in the
course of prehistory. Such ‘top-down’-perspectives deprived individuals and groups of genuine agency and creativity. In recent
years, a wide array of empirical results on social practices related to material culture and settlement dynamics, (inter-)regional
entanglements and spatial mobility based on Stable Isotope Analyses, aDNA etc. have come to the fore. Yet the question of
possible inferences regarding the social organization has not been sufficiently addressed.
The aim of the session is to study social practice and organization in Neolithic societies based on such results by adopting bottom-up perspectives. We want to discuss how data can be methodologically combined on the basis of corresponding theories
as well as the potential of such bottom-up approaches to infer models of social organization which could live up to the diversity
and dynamism of Neolithic societies. This might include perspectives on mobility, social complexity, the importance of (political)
interests and factors of kinship etc. We welcome papers that address the following questions:
•
What models of Neolithic societies are used in current research?
•
What kind of premises are projected onto the past and why?
•
What kind of data is available and how can we combine those to explore different forms of social organization?
•
What theories are used to approach social organization in prehistoric contexts?
•
How could archaeology benefit from anthropological perspectives?
•
What are the epistemological limits regarding the social organization of Neolithic communities?”
