In Eurasian Stone Age archaeology, two fundamentally different understandings prevail as to what is meant by the term “Neolithic”. In most parts of Europe, the Near East and Central Asia, the main characteristic is the transition from a foraging to a
producing economy, a process that can be accompanied by a variety of other traits such as sedentism, the development of
social inequalities, novel crafts and technologies, and the emergence of new ideological systems. In the Russian Federation,
further parts of the former Soviet Union and the neighboring regions, on the other hand, the main criterion for the beginning of
”the Neolithic” is the onset of ceramic vessel production, and hence, hunter-gatherer groups with pottery make up the majority
of “Neolithic” communities.
Various attempts have been made to address this terminological discrepancy between “Eastern” and “Western” archaeological
schools. Concentrating geographically in the intermediate area between the two poles (e.g., Poland, Finland, the Baltic States),
they can be grouped into four categories: 1) Application of compromise labels such as “Sub-Neolithic”, “aquatic Neolithic”, “ceramic Mesolithic”, 2) Search for early evidence of farming to prove a “true”, agricultural Neolithic, 3) Postulation of two Neolithic
processes, an agricultural and a non-agricultural, and 4) Revision of periodization terminology, generally from the eastern towards the western understanding of the term.
Just like the two main concepts, all of these compromise attempts are epistemologically problematic as they are rooted in the
specific “Denkstile” (sensu L. Fleck) of the scientific schools involved, their historical backgrounds and contemporary political
embeddedness. In our talk, we will show how these approaches go far beyond the problem of terminology, and how the term
“Neolithic”, actually, has in this respect become an agent itself in shaping the scientific agendas, influencing the formulation of
research questions and designs, and pre-conditioning the answers and interpretations
