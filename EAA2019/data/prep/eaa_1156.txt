WAS THERE A PLAN? THE SPATIAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE EARLY NEOLITHIC SITE OF
ALTSCHERBITZ (GERMANY)

Presentation Format: Oral
How spatial organization is linked to social organization is a long discussed matter not just in Neolithic research. The talk will
especially focus on current models and theories about social organization in settlements of the Linear and Stroke-ornamented
Pottery Culture (short: LBK and SBK). The discussion seems still being influenced by the famous „Hofplatzmodell“ (courtyard
model) as there are obviously some misunderstandings regarding the methods, assumptions and the model as a whole. Besides
that, small scale and more detailed analysis dominate current research and overall „ideas“ and models are discussed to a lesser
extent.
Thanks to largescale excavations in Central and East Germany, lots of Early Neolithic sites had been detected there. One of them
is Altscherbitz near the city of Leipzig (Saxony, Germany). This site is very special as it consisted of a large LBK settlement with
graveyard and some kind of „pioneer houses“ as well as a small SBK settlement – all in one place and excavated in their complete
dimensions. This opened up new extensive perspectives on Early Neolithic settlement organization and will be taken as the basis
for the talk´s subject.
