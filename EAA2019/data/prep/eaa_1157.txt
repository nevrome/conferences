This presentation addresses the issue of Early Neolithic societies from the perspective of a single site. Ludwinowo 7 is a big
Linear Pottery Culture settlement in Kuyavia (north-central Poland) which was excavated due to a large-scale motorway project.
It had been occupied by the first farming communities over a relative long time span of not less than six phases with at least foursix contemporary houses existing in each phase. This spatial and temporal dimension of research enables the study of the local
community at various micro-regional levels: house – household – neighbourhood – village. In our presentation we bring together
results of analysis of various data: portable (pottery, flint and stone artefacts as well as animal bones) as well as non-portable
(features, especially long houses). Our integrative study focuses on the issue of heterogeneities and complexities among LBK
inhabitants of Ludwinowo which offers a bottom-up approach contributing to discussions on the social organisation of the first
farmers in Central Europe.
