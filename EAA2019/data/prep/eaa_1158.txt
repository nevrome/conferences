Cross-cultural researchers have demonstrated that in agricultural societies, large dwellings are strongly associated with matrilocality—or the practice where new families live in the same community as the wife’s family. In contrast, smaller dwellings
are strongly associated with patrilocal societies, where newlyweds live in the communities of the husband. This is interesting
finding for many archaeologists, since dwelling size is a variable that can be determined across a multitude of archaeological
sites. For example, the Neolithic period (5500 – 4900 BC) in the European Temperate Zone (LBK) is well-known for the tradition of
longhouses with length up to 45 m. On the other hand, archaeological record provides little information about the family organization and post-marital residence during this time. Unfortunately, the in-depth re-examination of the correlation between large
household floor area and matrilocality among anthropological societies do not support the original hypothesis. The previous datasets were not controlled for phylogenetic non-independence, that arises through patterns of shared common ancestry, which
caused that results were biased. The aim of this contribution is to present results of our restudy and discuss the limitations of
cross-cultural research for archaeology in general.
