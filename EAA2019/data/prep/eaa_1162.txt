took place in the Balkans and Carpathian Basin in the period described. The changes touched various areas of live, but the most
important occurred in the sphere of funerary practice. The visible effects of these new cultural stream were a new approach to
the location and organisation of the cemeteries and a new character of the funeral rites paying more attention to the sex and
the social status of the dead. For the purpose of presenting differences in the way of adapting Copper Age social patterns in
the environment of post linear communities that lived north the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains, a combination of available archaeological, anthropological and biological data has been applied. As a result we can look at the described period from a
broader â€“ beyond cultural perspective. This study was supported by the National Science Centre of Poland (grant: Adaptation of
Transcarpathian cultural patterns of the Copper Age within the younger Danubian cultures in the Lesser Poland Upland, UMO2017/25/N/HS3/01140).
