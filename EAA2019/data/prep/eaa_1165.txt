Since the remarkable study on spatial analysis in archaeology by Hodder and Orton (1976), numerous papers noted that very
different prehistoric processes and phenomenon are recorded by similar statistical patterns. Respectively, this causes different
socio-cultural understanding of ‘archaeological culture’. In its simplest definition, this term means nothing but a certain way of
similarity in material assemblages. Therefore, we applied information theory to study unification and diversity in the dynamics
of ‘cultural development’. This paper supported by the grant from the NSC of Poland aims at the following issues. Are there any
most general trends of cultural development, which may be misunderstood for the markers of migrations or increase in interactions? Do we overestimate ‘mobility’ as an explanation for culture change after the recent advances in aDNA, strontium isotopes
analysis etc.? How the most general laws of cultural development are correlated with regional socio-cultural dynamics? These
issues are developed through the case studies on the Neolithic Cucuteni-Tripolye cultural complex and Eastern group of Funnel
Beaker culture.
