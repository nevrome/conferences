What proxies can provide us with information on social organisation, when there are no cemeteries to be studied? At the example
of circumalpine Neolithic lakeside settlements it can be shown, that very different indications have been used to infer social
organisation from find distributions. Which approach was correct? Or is it realistic, that every studied community had its own
system of signs and symbols? The settlement layouts seemed to be equally variable and were difficult to interpret.
Recently, first evidence was presented that these different settlement layouts may be reduced to different combinations of
recurring modular basic elements. Within these we found for the first time, that distribution patterns of the same find categories
proved helpful in different settlements. It seems therefore, that a starting point has been found. Furthermore, the first linear
models of find distributions were produced in an attempt to explicitly formulate assumptions and check one’s understanding of
deposition patterns. While it is necessary to embrace diversity, one neglected element of research might be repeatability. Data
are presented that indicate the existence of inheritable social functions in Late Neolithic societies.
A second approach is more speculative and uses recent results on the Neolithic economy to reflect on possible competences
that people in the aforementioned inherited functions may have had.
