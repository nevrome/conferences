FROM PILES TO SOCIAL SPACE: TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS IN PILE DWELLING SOCIETIES

Due to dendrochronology, runtimes of houses and settlements can be studied with a very high temporal resolution on the
year-level in pile dwellings. The results of the prealpine Neolithic period (4500-2000 BC cal) confirm high settlement dynamics
with rapid growth and shrinking, with single sites often covering not more than 10 – 15 years, single houses even less. Thus it
appears that every individual moved several times in its life.
Intra-site organisation and the spatial distribution of material culture often show distinct diversities between houses, but also
higher degrees of similarity, interaction and patterns of sharing between some – often neighboring - houses.
In this presentation I will argue that such short living settlement patterns with frequent relocations of people and sites indicate
social structures with a low level of spatial control and a high level of individual – or small group – mobility. Further considerations
about possible connections between spatial patterns and social and economical patterns are based upon the structuralistic «
correspondence – noncorrespondence » approach (Hillier/Hanson 1984 : The social logic of space). Further hints towards a high
spatial dynamics of individuals and small groups might be found in material culture distribution patterns. Also, the question of
the smallest and biggest decision making units and how they interact with each other and the environment could be interesting
to understand possible reasons for the observed high spatial and temporal dynamics in Neolithic wetland societies.
