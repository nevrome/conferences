The Young Neolithic Michelsberg Culture (4300-3500 cal BC) has been a miracle for many decades. With little to no evidence for
house structures, but impressive evidence of enormous enclosures, an apparently reduced agricultural spectrum and an alleged
emphasis on herding, Michelsberg has escaped traditional conceptions of early farming societies in Temperate Europe.
More appropriate appear interpretations drawing on evidence from societies with a strong agropastoral component and a settlement system characterized as “shifting sedentism”. Such societies have been and are continuously documented in eastern
and southern Africa. We present ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence from Zimbabwe, and try to sketch out a model for the
“Michelsberg System”.
What emerges is a complex model of societies with short-term relocation of their farming hamlets and villages, but whose broader land-use strategy is focused around fortified aggregation sites of which at least some may have had ritual components. Major
Michelsberg sites were aligned along long-distance exchange routes, which may have channeled cattle over medium ranges and
also salt and jade objects in a complex system. This system emerged around 4200 cal BC and reached a tipping point between
3800 and 3600 cal BC, after which it declined rapidly.
