Format: Workshop
No epoch has ever been so determined by the exchange of information as the century we live in today. The easiest way to grasps
the continuous flow of data and opinions is the Internet. It is omnipresent and characterizes our work and everyday life. There can
be no doubt: communication is the key to our modern society.
Nevertheless, training in professional communication is rare in the archaeological community and certainly not part of the normal curriculum.
In the workshop we will talk about the process of external information transfer in the context of archeological projects and small
institutions. We will discuss target groups and news factors. Furthermore we will explore the possibilities that owned media
provide for the communication of our archaeological work, like websites, Facebook and Twitter accounts. We are also going to
look into feedback analysis to improve the impact of our massage. We will discuss the need for more communication training for
archaeologists and how this could be accomplished. Contributions should be in form of impulse presentations 10 minutes each.
In an atmosphere of open dialogue, there will be plenty of opportunity for mutual exchange and questions.
