NEGOTIATING POWER IN NEOLITHIC COMMUNITIES â€“ THE POLITICS OF COHABITATION
Author(s): Furholt, Martin (University of Oslo)
Presentation Format: Oral
Neolithic communities are often either described as the cradles of emerging private property and social inequality or as egalitarian, but politically static entities. More recently, inner- and inter-community dynamics have been highlighted, and different
lines of social conflict have been discussed in the context of early sedentary, food-producing communities in different parts of
Europe. In this paper, I want to explore the interrelation and interaction of different social actors and units in Neolithic communities, relating to distribution, exchange and sharing of resources, and different, potentially conflicting, levels of decision-making.
I want to explore the role these negotiations over power might have had for the social composition and political organization of
communities. In connection to this I want to discuss the potential interaction between the local politics, and regional mobility
and regional interaction patterns. These topics will be approached using a bottom-up approach, concentrating on a number of
case studies from the European Neolithic.
