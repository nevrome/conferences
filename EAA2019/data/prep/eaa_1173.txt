The supposed uniformity of material culture and burial rite of the Final Neolithic archaeological cultures was in the past (especially culture historical) interpretations related to mass migrations. Although these interpretative frameworks were undermined
during the second half of the 20th century, the recent onset of the stable isotope and aDNA analyses brought it back. More
importantly it seems that these results are often interpreted with only limited insight from archaeology or social anthropology.
Nevertheless, detailed archaeological analyses of the archaeological evidence combined with theory gives us another important line of evidence of the prehistoric mobility. This paper will show on the example of the Corded Ware culture from Moravia
(Czech Republic) how detailed quantified analyses of the archaeological evidence can contribute to the exploration of social
structure and mobility patterns. Taking into consideration the complete archaeological record from the region I will present what
is the relationship between the traditional definition of archaeological culture and the reality of the past societies and how we
impose our current social models on them. This paper will also explore the ways how archaeologist can understand the prehistoric social practices on the local and regional level which is crucial for the bottom-up approaches and should precede large-scale
syntheses.
