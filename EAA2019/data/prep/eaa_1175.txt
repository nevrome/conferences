In this presentation we plan to revisit the social and symbolic practices observed at the Petit-Chasseur necropolis in Sion (Valais,
Switzerland) through the technological analysis of its Final Neolithic and Bell Beaker pottery.
The results we will present are part of an ongoing SNF research project at the University of Geneva (2017-2021, PI M. Besse,
and more specifically of a PhD thesis, Derenne) centered on social interactions and filiations in the Upper Rhône valley during the
Final Neolithic, the Bell Beaker Culture, and the Early Bronze Age (2800-1800 BC).
Over the course of a millennium, Petit-Chasseur prehistoric populations erected and used 12 megalithic monuments accompanied by anthropomorphic stelae. During this time the site underwent several considerable changes in its status and architecture,
with the addition of adventitious cists, the violation of several dolmens, and the construction of cairns in four different phases.
The technological analysis of pottery – following the chaîne opératoire concept – allowed us to trace back to the manufacturing
traditions of the people that used the necropolis. These data on fashioning, finishing treatments, and decoration techniques,
combined with the information on the type of pottery deposit, show that the traditions changed significantly during these three
periods. These data therefore validate the idea that the site was subject to major modifications throughout its occupation, both
in terms of its function and use, and help us better understand the social and symbolic dynamics that unfolded in this central
part of the Upper Rhône valley.
