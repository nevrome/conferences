PURGING OUR APPROACH TO NEOLITHIC SOCIETIES: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE TERMS, ANALYTICAL
CATEGORIES AND CULTURAL CONCEPTS USED IN RESEARCH
Author(s): Röder, Brigitte (Universität Basel)
Presentation Format: Oral
Empirical research, the integration of methodological and theoretical approaches adopted from the social sciences as well as
aDNA and isotope analyses are significantly changing our view of the social conditions in the European Neolithic. Although this
change might seem almost imperceptible, it is nevertheless fundamental in terms of both historical interpretation and epistemological approaches.
This can be seen, for example, in the integration of new terms and analytical categories such as ‘communities of practice’, while
other terms such as ‘society’ or ‘culture’ are increasingly being avoided though ultimately not explicitly rejected. Boosted by
the use of new methodological and theoretical approaches, the inventory of terms and analytical categories is thus constantly
extended. The terminology is becoming more diverse, but at the same time also increasingly incoherent. One of the two main
objectives of my paper is to reorganize this ever-growing array of tools and to stimulate a discussion about whether some of
them could or should be winnowed out.
