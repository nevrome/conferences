My second concern is to address the astonishing persistence of certain cultural concepts around the alleged ‘fundamental
forms of human cohabitation’. These include, for example, the notion that biological nuclear families are ‘the germ cells of all
societies’, and the tendency to project modern gender stereotypes onto prehistory. Despite the process of change mentioned
above, such ideas still shape current research. This is reflected, above all, at the historical interpretation level, which, as a result
of cross-fading with cultural concepts, falls short of the innovative potential of new approaches, questions and perspectives.
Against this background, the ‘un-packing of Neolithic societies’ should be accompanied by a ‘purging of Neolithic societies’ since
it is only by carrying out a critical review of the terms, analytical categories and cultural concepts, that the current process of
change will be allowed to develop its full potential.
