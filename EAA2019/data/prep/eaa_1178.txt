ABANDONING NEOLITHIC SOCIETIES? A PRACTICE-BASED APPROACH
Author(s): Veling, Alexander (Freie Universität Berlin)
Presentation Format: Oral
The paper provides an outsider’s view on the discussion of the Neolithic. This gives the opportunity to reflect central theories,
assumptions and narrative elements in this field of research by asking naïve (=uninformed) questions on its basic concepts and
their theoretical interaction. What possibilities are discussed to bridge the scalar gap from the archaeological record to macro-phenomena like society, culture or the Neolithic? Do we still need accumulative concepts, or should we keep single elements
of the archaeological record disconnected? Are there solid methodologies for macro-research based on the archaeological record? And should we abandon macro-concepts at all?
These questions are based on the detailed reflection of practice-based approaches in German-speaking Sociology discussed in
the paper by presenting three central elements of practice theories and the concept of an “archaeology of practices”, developed
by the author. On this basis the paper will discuss if there is a theoretical connection of practices and the archaeological record
and how we can approach it empirically. The big question behind is what we can learn about societies and cultures of the Neolithic
and if we can learn anything at all.
