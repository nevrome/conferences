of sugar products. They include the following: (a) the roles in the sugar-making process of vessels such as basins and for storage
alongside the well-known conical mould and molasses jar, (b) the identity of the purification/clarification agents, (c) the individual
stages in the sugar-making process as depicted in the 18th century painting in the Correr Museum, Venice. Finally (d) an explanation for the apparent contrast between the plentiful evidence that many sugar pots were used once and thrown away, while
others were recycled; in addition, most importantly, some pots, travelling with their contents, were involved in the chain that led
from primary production to secondary refining to selling/consumption centre.
