Puerto de Palos was a natural port on the inlet bank of the Tinto River, on the Atlantic south coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The
excavation has recovered the alota, i.e., a large building usually present in medieval ports that was used as customs and for port
transactions. This 600 m2 building was divided into three parts: the tavern, the storehouse, and the inn. Moreover, the building
had a chamber where the pottery workshop was placed. Besides the alota, there is a well, remains of other walls and pavements,
up to 40 pottery dumps, and a group of 90 sugar cones ready for use.
The workshop included at least 12 kilns, but there is evidence for the existence of five more. One of these kilns is to cook food,
and another one is a lime kiln. Two big kilns, up to 4.4 m in height, were used for building materials. The kilns and pottery dumps
cover a total area of 800-1000 m2, and it can be considered the best-preserved pottery production center in Europe for the
15th-16th centuries AD.
Fifty ceramics of different types (sugar cones, coarse wares, cooking wares, transport jars, glazed wares, and majolica) have
been characterized by a set of complementary techniques (X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope). The results have enabled to define the reference groups and to identify the production techniques used for each ceramic
class. Thus, this study enables to compare the technical aspects that sugar cones share with other ceramic classes, but also the
differences due to the constraints imposed by their performance characteristics.
