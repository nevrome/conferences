The sugar trade activity and the introduction of this product into the European diet and pharmacopeia, raised a high volume of
exports that linked the Atlantic.
The increasing number of archaeological works carried out in the Portuguese territory allowed to gather several ceramic forms,
such as sugar moulds, whose functions were directly related to the sugar manufacture. It seems clear that Portugal maintained
an intense production of these objects to fill the needs of their colonial regions, since there was a scarce production in the Iberian peninsula. We highlight the studies developed in Madeira, a sugar mould receiving centre, but above all the Lisbon and Aveiro
pottery workshops that provide an important volume of archaeological data that needs to be systematized.
