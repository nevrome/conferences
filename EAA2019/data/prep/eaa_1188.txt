This paper wants to explore the use of cloth seals for the study of northern European textile trade by analysing selected examples from Hanse towns. Cloth seals are valuable evidence on the distribution of commercially produced and marketed textiles on
European markets in the premodern period. They have great potential for the study of (changing) market compositions as they
allow us insights into the different brands and types of textiles traded to a given market in a given period.
This paper is particularly dedicated to relating cloth seals issued at Hanse towns to qualitative and quantitative written records,
such as namely the production statutes that often describe the cloth seals associated with a certain product. The production
records thus link cloth seals to certain production standards and, at times, inform us about the production process. As guilds
often produced different types of cloth identified with different seals, relating both sources more closely offers a better understanding of textile markets. Customs and other accounts furthermore attach value to the cloth certified with the cloth seals.
As will be exemplified in this paper using evidence from the Hanse area, in combination, this written and archaeological evidence
offers a more differentiated view on northern European textile markets.
