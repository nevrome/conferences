The hanseatic town of Tallinn has excellent collection of written sources concerning 15th-16th century trade relations, from
personal level to much broader issues. Among other issues there is also good datasets on late medieval and early modern cloth
trade, including even samples of textile attached to the merchants account books.
Yet the other facet of this topic - physical evidence in a form of archaeological finds from urban archaeological excavations in
the walled town of Tallinn and its suburbs - has been until very recently rather modest. Textile survives in Tallinn only in a very rare
occasions and even the number of cloth seals was up to 2017 almost non-existent, that is less than 10 items.
This has changed drastically with one site, excavated between Spring 2018 and early Spring 2019: suburban town block at Jahu
/ VÃ¤ike-Patarei St. This site revealed more than 20.000 artefacts of what the majority has been closely dated between the 2nd
quarter of 15th and late 15th century. This collection, currently interpreted as a late medieval landfill reflecting the material
culture of intra muros plots includes also large amount of finds connected to textile trade. Among other things 75+ late medieval
cloth seals have been unearthed thus far (this is still work in progress), giving thus us now a excellent opportunity to compare
textual and artefactual evidence of late medieval cloth trade of Tallinn.
The present paper will introduce this new collection of finds as well as attempts to set the artefacts into the broader archaeological and historical framework.
