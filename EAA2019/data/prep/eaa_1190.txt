NORTH SEA TEXTILE TRADE

In 2018, the National Museum of Antiquities at Leiden (the Netherlands) acquired an old collection of 84 lead cloth seals, found
with metal detectors in the so-called Drowned Land of Zeeland in the 1970s and 1980s. The seals were found mostly in the
area of the famous drowned village of Nieuwlande and its surroundings, fully lost in the St Felix’s flood of 1530, which provides
a ‘terminus ante quem’ for all these seals.
The collection consists of mostly rivet type seals (58) but also bag and bulla type, ranging from 13 tot 42 mm wide. They are
decorated with many coats of arms (27), symbols and letters, both stamped and also scratched secundary into the seal. The
seals, and thus the cloth, used here in ‘Sea-Land’, came mostly from cloth centres in southern England, the western Netherlands,
Flanders, northern Germany and coastal France, thus indicating a cloth trade centred around the North Sea and most likely determined by waterways,
Various other groups of cloth seals from this area, held for instance by the Stichting Cultureel Erfgoed Zeeland in Middelburg,
and recent finds like the many seals (and a pair of seal tongs) from the metro excavations at Amsterdam, confirm this maritime
orientation of the trade in the Netherlands, but also shows that the signature of every single cloth using place is different.
