are found mostly on two types of sites. The most common type of site are medieval urban excavations which has provided the
largest quantity of the artefact. The other type of site is less obvious, and not as associated with trade as urban areas, the castle. In Scandinavia, a considerable number of lead cloth seals have been found from excavations at castles, which has increased
our knowledge of the cloth industry.
This paper focuses on the evidence of imported cloth in medieval and early modern castles. It will discuss why are cloth seals
usually discovered there? What kind of roles did cloth play in the castles? What kinds of networks do the seals indicate? Are they
only evidence of trade? Or should we try to find other interpretations? This paper focuses on these questions based both on the
archaeological finds and the written record from the castles.
