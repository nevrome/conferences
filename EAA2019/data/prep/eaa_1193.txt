However, a number of written sources add significant insight into the supply, accession and consumption of cloth in Early Modern
Denmark. The probate inventories of the city of Elsinore is the most comprehensive body of inventories from any city in Early
Modern Denmark. The thousands of records, that is preserved from 1571 onwards, is a unique, but still a virtually unexploited
resource for insight into the consumption of cloth. An analysis reveals the worth of the cloth, the types and origins, the origin
and contacts of the retailers and traders. Cross-references between the inventories and preserved clothing items from contemporary burials allow us to get insight into the types of cloth and the clothing items produced. However, the significant insight
into rich and poor households in the city allows us to see not only fur and velvet but also patched aprons, worn tablecloths and
pawned skirts. This paper will thus adress the socio/cultural imprint of the cloth, contextualise the worth of the cloth and lay out
a few paths for possible further studies.
