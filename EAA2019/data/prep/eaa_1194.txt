TRADE
Author(s): Lipkin, Sanna (University of Oulu)
Presentation Format: Oral
Some lead cloth seals have been found in various excavations conducted in northern Finland. Few of the seals have been found
in rural contexts while others have been found in towns of Oulu and Tornio. Specifically, in this presentation, the lead cloth seals
found in Oulu are examined based on their find contexts. Additionally, it will be evaluated what these lead cloth seals reveal of the
textile trade routes to the north, imported fabric types, the origin of the fabrics, and if they correspond with the archaeological
textile finds excavated in Oulu Cathedral church yard, or the information gained concerning the fabric types mentioned in probate
inventories. The most intriguing fact is that inside some of the lead cloth seals remains of actual fibers or pseudomorphs have
been found. These prove that inspecting the seals for fibers or pseudomorphs before conservation is crucial. These tiny remains
reveal offhand the type and colours of the fabrics stamped with the seals.
