CLOTH SEALS IN SWITZERLAND
Author(s): Ackermann, Rahel (Swiss Inventory of Coin Finds)
Presentation Format: Oral
The study of «Swiss Cloth Seals» is at its very beginning. The first items among archaeological finds were published as late as
1970, and their registering among the archaeological finds is still selective or at random. We lack a common terminology and, in
some cases, the importance of these items and their potential as a primary source for Late Medieval and Early Modern economic
history is still not recognised.
A first overview, covering published lead seal findings in Switzerland, was given in 2016 (Ackermann/Zäch 2016). Since then,
more items were published or made accessible. To bring forward this topic, we started, in some cantons, the systematic registery and study of cloth seals and other lead seals. The material at our disposal is manyfold. On one side we have findings from
archaeological excavations, some in dated context, and from surveys, the cloth seals showing a wide range of tissue imports.
On the other side two major production centers in today Switzerland attached cloth seal to their products, the cities of Fribourg
with its woolen tissues, and of Saint-Gall with its linnen production. The typology of their cloth seals is yet to be established.
The paper will summ up the current state of research in Switzerland and give a first systematic survey of the local cloth seal
findings, allowing then to integrate Switzerland in the European cloth trade network.
