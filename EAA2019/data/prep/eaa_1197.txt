to a large amount of available written sources. Several scholars contributed to this topic yet in the 1960s and 1970s, namely
György Székely and Zsigmond Pál Pach. At the same time, Lajos Huszár and Walter Endrei evaluated the first, although quite
limited groups of available cloth seals. However, the growing number of cloth seals collected during the last couple of decades
has provided a significant amount of new data not documented in the archival material. The largest such collection of cloth seals
in Hungary datable to the 15th-16th C. was found during rescue excavations in a Western-Hungarian small town of Pápa. The
finds are the best indicator of the extensive market activity of the city. Several types of cloth seals are still known only from this
excavation, namely Kulmbach, Hof a/d Saale, and Wurzen. These results gave the most important impulse for the research of the
cloth seals in the former Kingdom of Hungary. There are about 15 hundred seals that have been recorded in the Carpathian Basin
(including Hungary, Slovakia, and parts of Romania and Ukraine.
This paper presents the main types of cloth seals found in Hungary and their provenance including the probable contemporary
forgeries.
