Flemish lead cloth seals were found in many places of Eastern Europe, since the Flemish textile was an expensive goods that
were traded in all large cities. A lot of seals were found in Novgorod excavations, the former “gateway” of Russia, open for trade
with Europe. But much more finds were fixed on the territory of the capital cities of the Golden Horde State in the Lower Volga
region. Recently 1 new point of mass finds of Flemish seals appeared on the map of Eastern Europe - this is the city of Bolgar,
which was one of largest Eastern Europe cities of in 13-14th cc. During the archaeological excavations of the central market of
this city, on an area of about 1000 square meters, 23 seals were found. Seventeen seals were directly connected with the ruins
of the central market building dated 1350-1360s, and 6 were found in an earlier context (1340-1350s). Exact dates are based
on the findings of about 1000 coins in the layers of destruction of the market and underlying level.
Three seals belonged to the West-Dutch city of Dixmude, one – to the city of Damme (port of the city of Brugge), one – to the city
of Tournai (Flemish “Doornik”). Most of the seals do not have an exact attribution, however the seals of the cities Ieper, Lo-Renninge (Belgium) or Aire (France) are supposedly identified.
Judging by the high concentration of seals, the central market of the city of Bolgar would be the center of expensive luxury goods
trade, among which Flemish textiles occupied one of the first places.
