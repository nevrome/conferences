The lead trade seals are important artifacts, that document international trade throughout Europe. In the Czech Republic, the
evidence and analysis of these artifacts are at very beginning. The paper deals with information about cloth seals research in
the Czech Republic, their archaeological context and circumstances of their discovery. While only a small number of seals have
been found during archaeological researches, many finds come from using of metal detectors. The oldest known seals in the
Czech Republic date back to the 14th century, most of them coming from the 15th to the 18th century. The origin of seals includes most of the well-known business centers, especially Northern and Western Europe. A big collection of seals found during
archaeological research in Mikulov will be used as a model example. A great deal of attention is paid to the findings of Czech
provenience seals. Seals from the 19th - 20th centuries are also investigated and the international trade in grain and flour is
particularly interesting here.
