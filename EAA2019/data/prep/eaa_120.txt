LJUBLJANA

Presentation Format: Oral
In the last years, as the result of fast urban development, the capital city of Slovenia is flooded by many building projects in the
city centre. Due to ample renovations in the area abundant in archaeology, excavations are necessary. With ongoing research on
many streets and squares of Ljubljana, archaeologists got the unique opportunity of presenting the national heritage to the public and opened a possibility for frequent relaying of detailed information about our shared past. Engaging the public in archaeological excavation could lead to a more effective long term heritage preservation. Since 2017, the priorities are focused on the professional performance of field work, post-excavation analyses and documentation, and building comprehensive PR campaigns
and public engagement. We brought back into use - at that time unfunctional - the web portal (Ne)odkrita arheologija Ljubljane
((Un)covered Archaeology of Ljubljana). The portal and its name became synonymous for shared PR platform for Archaeological
Research Consortium for Ljubljana, the contractor of archaeological excavations in Ljubljana and the City Museum of Ljubljana,
the coordinator of the projects. We create and develop the most diverse material on all the projects and leading media campaigns. One of our main programs is led via social media and website. We are organizing free of charge professional public guided
tours on different sites, curating different photo exhibitions connected with current archaeological projects and exhibitions of
the most interesting artefacts in the City Museum of Ljubljana. Last but not least, we are presenting the results of archaeological excavations and their public outreach in Ljubljana at many lectures for professional and non-professional audiences.
