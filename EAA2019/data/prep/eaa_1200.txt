Despite the large amount of interdisciplinary projects on the Neolithic to Bronze Age transition involving bioarchaeological research, it seems difficult to reconstruct the processed that lead to major cultural and demographic changes in Central Europe in
the 3rd millennium BCE. With continuous improvements of analytical methods, the amount of data is constantly growing and by
combining results from different disciplines, a more comprehensive synthesis can be acquired.
Our session aims to bring together specialist from different disciplines working on Late Neolithic and early Bronze Age material
to increase our understanding of the transformative processes that shaped this period. We want to provide a platform for discussions to obtain a bigger picture and state-of-the-art knowledge about lifestyle and population dynamics of the Late Neolithic
and early Bronze Age in Central Europe.
We welcome contributors who work on Late Neolithic material from Central Europe and focus on one or more of the following
