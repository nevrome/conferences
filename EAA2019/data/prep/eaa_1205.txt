Major genetic changes in European populations occurred at the beginning as well as final stages of the Neolithic period as shown
by recent genetic studies. The transition from hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists and farmers in the 6th millennium BCE coincided with a human migration from the Near East. A second migration into Central Europe occurred originating from the Pontic
steppe in the 3rd millennium BCE and was linked to the spread of the Corded Ware Culture which ranged as far southwest as
modern day Western Switzerland. These genetic processes are well studied, for example for the Middle-Elbe-Saale region in
Germany, however, little is known from the regions that connect Central and Southern Europe.
In this study, we investigate genome-wide data from 97 individuals from the Swiss Plateau, Southern Germany and the Alsace
Region in France that span the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age (3500 to 2000 BCE). Our results show a similar
genetic process as reported for the Middle-Elbe-Saale region suggesting that the migration from the Pontic steppe reached all
the way into the Swiss Plateau. However, our evidence suggests that the onset of that transition may have started even earlier
in Switzerland compared to the Middle-Elbe-Saale region.
