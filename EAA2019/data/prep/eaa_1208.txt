This paper will give an introduction to the session “What is a village? Challenging concepts and methods of Iron Age and medieval
villages, hamlets and single settlements.” There has been a common assumption that there did not exist villages in Norway, while
Denmark and southern Sweden are well known for their villages going back to the Bronze Age. Archaeological investigations does
however indicate villages and nucleated settlements also in Norway, in addition to single farms. We thus need to think new about
the settlement pattern. Why did someone choose to live in a village? Was it because of differences in ownership to land, or was
it a desire of communion and safety that made people wanting to live close together?
The term village has been widely discussed within geographical, historical, archaeological, and anthropological research. Definitions are often related to the numbers of farms/buildings and spatial properties of farmsteads. Judicial and social rights/aspects
such as land ownership, tenure and land use as well as the interdependency between the farmsteads and/or formal institutions
as churches or schools has also been considered. The question become more complicated when we consider different temporal
scales and geographical regions. The paper will discuss some aspects related to different terminologies and question the different concepts and methods of different settlement structure and landscape organization.
