Due to the use of mechanical topsoil stripping as a frequent survey and excavation method since the early 1990s, a large number of agricultural settlements from the Late Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age have been recorded in Rogaland, Southwest
Norway. It seems that this was a period where established farm areas expanded and new land was cleared to facilitate farming,
grazing and the construction of settlements. In some areas, the settlement had a village or hamlet like structure in the Pre-Roman Iron Age, but in general, single farms dominate. From this period, we also have a large number of single or small clusters of
cooking pits scattered in the meadows and outfield areas nearby the settlements. Such structures are rarely accounted for
when discussing farms and farm organisation, but they indicate that the settlement expansion also resulted in an increased, and
perhaps new, use of the surrounding landscape.
In this paper, I will discuss the settlement pattern and organization of farms in Rogaland during the Late Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age, based on a collocation of all radiocarbon dates from this period. The number of excavations and surveys are not
equally distributed throughout the county, but even so, the data reveals both variations and similarities between different landscapes and regions within Rogaland. Put together, the data gives information about the intensity and form of settlements, how
single and clusters of farms were organized, and how settlements were situated in the landscape. The data also reveals how the
surrounding landscape was an important resource and an integrated part of the farm structure.
