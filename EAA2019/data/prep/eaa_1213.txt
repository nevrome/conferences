THE FOUNDING OF THE EARLIEST VILLAGES IN SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIA

Presentation Format: Oral
A case study from Northern Jutland, Denmark presenting current research on the Early Iron Age settlement patterns. At the transition between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age a shift in settlement patterns can be observed in the northern parts of Jutland,
Denmark. Large villages with 10 or more concurrent farmsteads suddenly emerges, showing no gradual development from the
single-farms that dominated during the Bronze Age. So why did people choose to live in a village? This paper will discuss some of
the interpretations that has been presented so far. Did the changes arise out of climatic, ecological or demographic reasons or
should the emergence of villages be associated with a more violent period with raids and plunders? Furthermore, the changes
within settlement structure must have influenced the landscape organization, or perhaps vice versa.
Did the shift in settlement pattern result in more fundamental changes within the society? Analysis of the spatial lay-out of the
sites does indicate that an increase in hierarchization is observable. The hierarchization cannot be seen in the burial data of the
period of interest, and only large-scale settlement excavation enables us to recognise these differences that challenges the
narrative of Early Iron Age Scandinavia.
