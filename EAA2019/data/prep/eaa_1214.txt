THE DEEP HISTORY OF SINGLE FARMS IN ØRLAND, NORWAY

Ørland is a peninsula on the Norwegian coast, strategically positioned at the important crossroads of the coastal naval route and
the naval route to the inland via the Trondheim fjord.
In 2015 and 2016 an area of 110 000 m2 of cultivated land at Vik, Ørland was excavated due to the enlargement of the Norwegian main Air Base, revealing traces of eight Iron Age farmsteads. The flat land rose from the sea around 2600 BP +/- 100 years.
Indications are that the land was divided into fairly equally sized plots very soon after the peninsula was inhabitable around 400
BC. During the course of the Early Iron Age (c. 500 BC – AD 575) no major changes in the distribution of land occurred. Instead,
the division of land from c. 400 BC remained the basic idea. The settlement declined from c. AD 350, and vanished completely
around AD 575.
Situated in a costal environment, people in Ørland were probably in touch with settlements along the Norwegian and Danish
coasts, where nucleated settlements and villages from the same period occurred. However, an idea of a village did not transfer
to Ørland. Farms remained separate, even when situated as close as 150 m apart. Still, the outfields might have remained a
common economic resource. Indications are also that farms specialized their production in the Roman Iron Age and thus perhaps
took part in a larger, economic cooperation.
