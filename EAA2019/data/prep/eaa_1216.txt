a veritable golden age for the study of prehistoric settlements in Norway. In combination with an explosive growth in excavation
activity, this created a massive increase in the number of recorded Iron Age buildings, particularly from the early Iron Age (500
BCE–500 CE). Despite this, no settlements larger than a single farm have been found in SE Norway, and the general picture has
been that of a dispersed settlement characterized by single farms dotting the landscape.
The recently finished excavations at Dilling in Rygge, Østfold municipality, stands in stark contrast to this established pattern.
For the first time a large, contiguous settlement has been excavated in SE Norway. Here, over 130 buildings largely dating to the
period 200 BCE–200 CE was recorded within an area of 7 hectares. The internal organization within the site suggests that it consisted of at least six or seven closely clustered farms. Although no remains of formalized boundaries were found, the excavation
results suggest that each farm had a separate plot for small scale cultivation and cooking pits close to the farmstead.
When compared to the existing data from the region, the sheer scale and density of the finds at Dilling makes it clear that this
represents a distinctly different type of settlement. However, the site differs quite significantly from the neatly ordered villages
found in South Scandinavia in this period. The results from Dilling thus prompts us to reevaluate not only what we know of the
settlement patterns in SE Norway in the early Iron Age, but also the applicability of the existing settlement terminology in a
regional context.
