AN ABSENCE OF VILLAGE COMMUNITIES IN EASTERN DENMARK DURING THE IRON AGES?

Working within the field of contract archaeology on Zealand in Eastern Denmark, we are dealing with a long established truth
about the absence of village communities in this part of the country during the Iron Ages. The traditional view of the settlement
structure on Zealand has been one of predominantly single farmsteads, whereas village communities known from classic sites
such as Hodde, Nørre Snede and Vorbasse has traditionally been regarded as a phenomenon primarily linked to the Jutland Peninsula.
Nevertheless, many new excavations, a wider use and more systematic approach to radiocarbon dating paired with the advents
in Bayesian Modelling, has left the old explanations of settlement structures wanting. Simultaneously there has also been a shift
in focus from the excavation of a house to the excavation of a community. It is very much a theoretical shift but in practice, this
means that excavations now cover significantly larger areas that are stripped of the topsoil, compared to the norm just 5-10
years ago. This has led to the excavation of Iron Age communities that, despite the lack of most of the trademarks of the Jutland
loci classici, best can be described as villages.
Even so, these new insights and large datasets presents more questions than answers. How should we interpret and define the
social structures of these communities and how do we overcome the persisting problem of the still insufficient precision of the
radiocarbon-based chronologies? In the presentation, these questions will be further discussed based on cases from recent
excavations on eastern Zealand.
