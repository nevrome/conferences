Presentation Format: Oral
Ongoing development-led fieldwork has documented a large settlement complex dating from the Early Iron Age and the Late Iron
Age/Viking Age around the medieval village of Ølsemagle, Eastern Denmark. Systematic radiocarbon dating of samples from
post-built longhouses has established a basic understanding of the intra-site chronology and spatial dynamics of the settlement. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the timing of some important key events and structural changes within the broader
chronological framework.
This case study will focus on the formation and development of a Late Iron Age/Viking Age settlement on the outskirts of the
present day Ølsemagle village. The site chronology indicates a probable hiatus and major relocations of the settlement center of
gravity preceding the Viking Age settlement phase. One objective is to determine the dating and duration of the relocated settlement by formal chronological modelling of the radiocarbon dates. Furthermore, the location of a Viking Age settlement phase
raises the question of continuities in the settlement structure from the Viking Age to the Early Medieval Period and it may be
possible to estimate the timing of some of the processes that formed the structural context of the medieval village community.
However, some fundamental uncertainties persist concerning the size and layout of farmsteads, the number of chronologically
interrelated farms and the level and tempo of dynamics occurring in the intervals between the defined key events. The presentation will consider approaches and some challenges to the modelling of these phenomena.
