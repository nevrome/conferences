ONLINE COMMUNICATION AROUND UNESCO PILE DWELLINGS IN AUSTRIA
Author(s): Dworsky, Cyril - LÃ¶w, Carmen (Kuratorium Pfahlbauten)
Presentation Format: Oral
In Vienna, the Kuratorium Pfahlbauten is responsible for the Austrian part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage of prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps. Considering that participation of the civic society is an integral part of the UNESCO World
Heritage Program, science engagement and science mediation play a special role among the tasks of the Kuratorium Pfahlbauten. The Kuratorium has been managing a Facebook account since 2012 and has been running its own weblog, the Pfahlbauten-Blog, since 2015 . For both channels, communication rules have been established, which in some cases differ significantly
from the usual way of communicating in the archaeological field. Traffic and target groups, which can be easily identified for both
channels, as well as the results of an international competition of science blogs, allow a data-based assessment and evaluation
of the benefits of online communication for the public relations of the UNESCO pile dwellings in Austria.
