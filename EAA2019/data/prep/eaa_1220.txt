ern part of Sweden. Why were people and rural production organized in villages, and who were the actors? For whom were villages
a successful concept and was one definition for villages really enough to describe the role villages played in different societies?
What links were there between villages and societies? All excavated farmsteads in the period AD 400â€“1800 were registered in a
GIS database that was used for large-scale analysis. Trends in ups and downs in the settlements at different times became visible. Large farm units/estates influenced village formation due to control over land and the ability to organize people and agrarian
production. Village nucleation in this region was considered as a precondition for state formation, as it guaranteed a stable and
continuous transfer of agrarian surplus through taxes.
