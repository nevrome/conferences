THE URBAN VILLAGE - CONSIDERATIONS ON THE SIZE, FUNCTION AND DESIGNATION OF GUDME,
FUNEN, DENMARK

Presentation Format: Oral
Iron Age Gudme, Funen, Denmark, is renowned for its magnificent hall-buildings, which are among the first and largest in Scandinavia, and seemingly functioned as socio-religious centres. Additionally, the site is characterised by a very large number of
individual farmsteads, and at its peak perhaps as many as 50 farms. The sheer number of farms clearly separates Gudme from
contemporary villages, which are never composed of more than a fraction of the Gudme farms. Virtually all habitable land was
taken, and during its peak the Gudme area could have accommodated a substantial amount of inhabitants – especially so when
considering the affiliated landing site at Lundeborg. A further conspicuous feature is the relative absence of a farming economy
at the farmsteads. Instead, highly specialised craftsmanship (perhaps trade) can be found in the area and the debris and tools of
gold- and silversmiths as well as bronze casting is easily recognisable. Thus, the Gudme situation can in many ways be paralleled
with an urban setting, but such a designation has in research been reserved for the later emporia. As such, the paper will discuss
the ‘upper limits’ of the concept of a village and the factors that designate urbanity and larger villages.
