In the late Middle Ages, the coastal area of Uusimaa, Southern Finland, was characterized by small villages and hamlets inhabited
by Swedish-speaking peasants. These villages have been thought to have been founded by Swedish peasants during a period between late 12th and mid-14th century, when a large number of people moved from mainland Sweden to Uusimaa. Based on place
name evidence, before this a scattered Finnish settlement was spread out in the area, but the extent and organization of this
earlier settlement, as well as its relationship to the newcomers, are poorly known and have often been considered insignificant.
The idea of a structured village landscape developed by early Swedish immigrants has been mainly based on later historical
sources, especially 17th and 18th century maps. However, the idea of these organized villages with several farms located on a
structured plot dating back to early Middle Ages has been questioned by recent archaeological research. A new picture of how
the villages in the area were founded and how they developed through time has emerged. The archaeological excavations have
shown that the villages have their origins in small settlements with both Swedish and Finnish speakers active in the village formation process. The late medieval villages with a structured layout were only the result of a long development. In this paper, this
development is discussed with examples from several archaeologically excavated village sites in the area.
