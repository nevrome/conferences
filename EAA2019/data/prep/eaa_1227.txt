WOULD SINGLE FARMS BUILD A CHURCH? TRYING TO TRACE CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
TROUGH INCOMPLETE DATA

Summer 2018, the archaeological museum of Stavanger excavated a large site in Madla, close to the medieval city of Stavanger
on southwest coast of Norway. Few years earlier the county archaeologists conducted extensive surveys and preliminary excavations on the site and its surrounding areas. The 14C-datings taken from the site cover all periods from Neolithic to medieval
times.
During the excavation in 2018, larger areas clustered with postholes and cooking pits were uncovered, along with some graves
and other structures. The postholes concentrate especially to two areas, one of which has a farmstead from migration period,
and the other with several simultaneous as well as overlapping buildings, at least from Viking age.
Right outside the excavated area lies also a medieval churchyard. The church was first mentioned in 1355, the priest already in
1298. If there has been enough people and a need for a church in Madla some 200-300 years after the last recognised houses
on the site, surely there has been more than one or two families living there in the Iron Age also?
The aim of my study is not only to look at changes on the site, but to turn the focus also out from it, to the surrounding area.
Looking into the reports from the countyâ€™s surveys and earlier excavations alongside the material from the excavations in 2018,
it seems that either the settlements have been more scattered in the late Neolithic and bronze age, e.g. single farms, or the
population has been more extensive than it was in the Iron Age. My hypothesis is that in the Iron Age and especially towards the
medieval, the settlement patterns have changed in the area, moving from single farms towards hamlets or little villages.
