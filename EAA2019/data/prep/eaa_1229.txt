Rauraci who had settled here and finally the foundation of the Colonia Raurica in 44 BC.
Against this background, regional research focussed primarily on (proto)urban settlements such as Oppida and the colony in
question, especially as rural settlements were hardly known.
With the increasing amount of developer funded archaeological investigations, the number of rural settlements has multiplied,
so that for the first time, thorough overviews of the Late Iron Age settlement in the southern Upper Rhine Valley are possible.
The starting point for this presentation is a multi-phase farmstead from Reinach (Switzerland, Canton Baselland). Thanks to an
exceptionally good preservation and the abundance of finds (including archaeobiological material), it is possible on the one hand
to reconstruct the settlement dynamics here, and on the other hand to identify areas used for different purposes within the site.
Furthermore, the southern Upper Rhine area will be considered as a unit across national borders and its rural settlement system
will be analysed. The focus here is on settlements that were in use during the period between the 1st century BC and the 1st
century AD. The aim of this analysis is to determine whether there is a common rhythm in the development and abandonment of
rural settlements in this region and whether the differences in the life duration of the individual settlements can be explained
topographically or functionally. Finally, I will discuss whether the far-reaching upheavals known from written sources in connection with the Gallic wars can be identified in the archaeological record.
