AN ARCHAEOLOGIST’S JOURNEY FROM GUERRILLA TACTICS TOWARDS STANDARDIZED COMMUNICATION PRACTICES
Author(s): Veranic, Dejan (Krajinski park Ljubljansko barje)
Presentation Format: Oral
Many of us share our results, comprehensions or report ones of our colleges. We improve archaeological site visibility in order
to add to its value and consequentially protection. Our efforts come in various forms such as posts, articles, reports, interviews
or other. However, it is often the case that with often limited resources our message doesn’t receive the visibility that we are
hoping for.
To showcase the situation described above and possible paths for improvement, an experiment will be conducted and its results
presented in the session. The experiment objective is to test various owned media that have the best engagement results for
different target groups. The process will begin with revising current communication strategy for the test archaeological site,
towards to processes and methods commonly used by communication specialists. That entails developing a communication
strategy applied to predominantly digital media, required new skillsets, metadata analysis, feedback analysis that will help revise
the message impact. Special attention will be dedicated to content creation and its application for different media and target
groups.
