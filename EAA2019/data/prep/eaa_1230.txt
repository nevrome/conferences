THE VILLAGE – VILL AND TOWNSHIP IN DENMARK IN A 1ST MILLENNIUM-PERSPECTIVE

Presentation Format: Oral
In the middle of the first millennium, the settlement organization was fundamentally changed in the area that constitutes present-day Denmark. The changes that can be observed and dated to the period around 600 AD have made particularly significant
archaeological imprints. This is not only reflected in a micro-perspective within the individual settlement – buildings, tofts and
relationships between them – but likewise, in the overall geographical settlement organization seen from a regional perspective
and across villages in different natural landscape types.
However, the changes of the settlement structure can also be seen on a more cognitive level and thus as decisive for the basic
perceptions of what we call villages today and how it could have been experienced in the Iron Age.
In the paper, I will present a case study from Funen and Jutland in Denmark and there will be a focus on the village as a concept
from two different perspectives; a user´s perspective within the village itself as well as an organizational perspective grounded
in central management and power. I will argue, that changes around 600 AD was initially a bottom-up-response to a centrally
initiated reorganization and division of landscapes, as simple fiscal rights to land was introduced as a backbone of central power,
in contrast to individual alliances and everchanging relations in the previous period.
The analyses are basically archaeological based, but also incorporates historical sources, maps and place names as part of an
extensive empirical basis. The presentation is part of the research project, ‘From Central Space to Urban Place’, which is funded
by the Velux Foundation as a four-year research project.
