(PRE)HISTORIC VILLAGES OF NORWAY

The single farm has been regarded as the standard agriculture settlement unit of Norway from the introduction of agriculture
onwards. Norwegian has no word for village, although the Danish term landsby has been used to describe a few prehistoric nucleated settlement, in particular Forsand. The last few years researchers have suggested there was villages in Norway in historic
times as well.
The historians Village-or-not discussion has focused on the so-called klyngetun, literally cluster farmyard. The klyngetun is well
recorded in Western Norway, and although most were demolished 1850â€”1950, a few are still preserved. The buildings of three
or more farms were set in a cluster and the cultivated land diverted into long and narrow strips. In most European countries, this
would be called a village or hamlet, but several researchers have argued that the klyngetun lack formal organization or institutions and they have therefore rejected the village interpretation.
I will argue that from an archaeological point of view, focusing on spatial organization of settlement and fields, there is no doubt
that the klyngetun really was a village or hamlet. Further, I will also demonstrate there were hamlet-like structures in prehistoric
Norway.
