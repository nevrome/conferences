Roman settlement after that time period.
The examined area was settled again in the 7th Century, with Slavs, arriving from the Pannonian Plane. In the Slovenian archaeology this process is understood as the onset of the Early Middle Ages.
The early medieval settlement, with its rural characteristics, was not homogeneous. Archaeological research shows diverse
dispersion of Slavic dwelling remains in the landscape, which significantly distinguish in number and form as well as in their interdependency to the landscape`s natural conditions. The natural landscape of the Drava Plain, with its surrounding hills, reflects a
diverse pattern of topographical features, which differ in slope degree, rock and soil bases, as well as in varying water regimes.
The early medieval archaeological evidence was correlated with the landscape`s natural features by the use of GIS tools. The
result is an interpretation of the settlement patterns through the time span of the Early Middle Ages.
