Presentation Format: Oral
Studies dealing with astronomical alignments encoded in public, ceremonial or funerary architecture not only inform us how the
heavens were known and experienced in particular places but also provide insights into how they were positioned within a broader context of human activities within which they functioned.
In order to treat archaeoastronomical sites as Ingold’s relational fields, the sightlines connecting sites with celestial targets
should be viewed as embodying relationships between those sites, particular landmarks and celestial targets, and human beings. These elements constitute webs of meanings within which specific activities were generated, performed, and negotiated.
To conclude, structures encoding celestial alignments embody the joint participation of different human and nonhuman entities
whose actions were regulated through the skywatching and timekeeping.
At many locations, astronomical alignments continue to make relationships with celestial bodies, maintaining their relatedness
with the neighboring others, even without the presence of ancient or native skywatchers. Therefore, observing astronomical
phenomena from archaeoastronomical sites not only enables today’s archaeoastronomers to perceive nearly the same events
as did the skywatchers in the remote past but also allows them to settle within similar (but not identical) relational fields to get
insights into the forms of engagement with other environmental components. The paper will draw examples from the archaeological sites from Mexico and Poland.
