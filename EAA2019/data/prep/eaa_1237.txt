THE ARCHEOLOGICAL PERTINENCE OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY: LESSONS-LEARNED FROM
COLLABORATION

Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeologists, cultural astronomers, and archaeoastronomers pursue tightly-linked disciplines while separated by our own divergent cultures. Historically, we have been asking different questions. Notwithstanding, archaeology and cultural astronomy
seek understanding of human culture, and specific to archaeoastronomy, we seek understanding of past cultures through the
empirical analysis of material culture evidence. Viewed through that lens, I suggest that archaeoastronomy or “skyscape archaeology” must strive to become, at least in part, an effective service discipline supporting broader archaeological inquiry.
Improved collaboration in the framing of research questions and research designs are critical to find “a route out of the impasse”
we have been experiencing. Review of three past examples of collaboration between archaeologists and archaeoastronomers
highlights a range of both successful and failed approaches. These examples are drawn from my primary area of research focus
over the past decade—the links between astronomy and the monumental architecture of the prehistoric Chacoan culture in
what is today the southwestern United States. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the results of these three efforts
are quite varied. In the best case, results were published that provide pertinent data that informs an active archaeological debate. In the worst case, results were published that could not be reproduced. I discuss how the definition of research questions,
the backgrounds and skills of researchers and research teams, and the collaborative process all have significant impact on outcomes.
