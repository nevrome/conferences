The claim that meteorite impacts shaped human history is a well-known element of (neo-)catastrophism. But so far no evidence
existed of any archaeological site directly being involved in an impact process. Such evidence has now resulted from the examination of “slags” from an excavation at Stöttham (Chiemgau, SE-Germany). Six samples, analyzed by polarizing microscope and
SEM-EDS, are complex combinations of rock with metallic residues: The rocky components show typical shock metamorphism,
characteristic of a meteorite impact. The metallic components are high lead bronze and iron - remnants of artefacts, which have
been overprinted by a meteorite impact. These are the to our knowledge first examples worldwide of artificial remnants co-existing with impact-diagnostic shock metamorphism.
The finds are linked to the Chiemgau Impact, a prehistoric meteorite impact, which hit SE-Germany and caused more than 100
craters of five to several hundred meters diameter in an area of ca. 60 x 30 km. Also finds of meteoritic material establish the
event. The impact has hitherto been dated to the Bronze Age/Iron Age. The new results from Stöttham specify the terminus post
quem of the Chiemgau Impact as ca. 900 BC.
Despite of the Chiemgau Impact being the biggest proven Holocene impact, its abruptness, the explicit archaeological evidence,
and its comparably good dating, cultural consequences aren’t identifiable so far. This results in methodological questions to the
(neo-)catastrophism paradigm.
