15 YEARS AFTER MERRIMAN - PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY: LOOKING BACK AND THINKING ABOUT THE
FUTURE
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Oldham, Mark (Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research) - Nienhaus, Luisa (University College London)
Format: Discussion session
In 2019, fifteen years have passed since the publication of the edited volume “Public Archaeology” (Merriman 2004), which
was inspired by a WAC session organised by Nick Merriman and Tim Schadla-Hall in 1999. This session aims to evaluate how the
discipline of public archaeology has evolved and changed over time and to establish whether the concepts discussed in the book
are still relevant in a much-changed world. We also want to look ahead and build upon the work and ideas put forward in “Public
Archaeology” by thinking about future directions and challenges.
We therefore seek both papers that offer a retrospective on this important early publication and papers which take the baton
from Merriman et al and look towards the next fifteen years of public archaeology.
We are particularly interested in papers that explore one or more of the following topics:
•
Commemoration and identity
•
Archaeology and political engagement
•
Communicating archaeology
•
Archaeology ‘of the public’
•
Professionalisation and voluntarism in archaeology
