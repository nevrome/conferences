ASTRONOMICAL DATA AND THEIR USEFULNESS FOR DATING ANCIENT SOCIETIES
Author(s): Gautschy, Rita (University of Basel)
Presentation Format: Oral
Documented astronomical observations such as the heliacal rising and setting of stars and planets, eclipses or the first and
last visibility of the lunar crescent can be used to establish absolute dates for ancient societies. Frequently utilised in earlier
times, the usefulness of ancient astronomical observations for dating purposes was questioned and even rejected during the
last thirty years. Referring to preserved data from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia from the 2nd millennium BCE the potential
of different sets of astronomical data as well as the uncertainties and possible pitfalls of this dating method will be discussed.
