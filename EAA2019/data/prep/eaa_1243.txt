Astronomical data in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia were mainly documented for religious purposes in the 2nd millennium
BCE. Thus, the data have to be extracted from texts and interpreted – different views about their nature (observed, calculated
or predicted) and their interpretation are the most common source of disagreement between different scholars that may lead
to diverging chronological solutions. Another point of concern is the fact that calculations of astronomical events far in the past
are subject to uncertainties (e.g. the slowing down of Earth’s rate of rotation). Additionally, since most documented ancient
astronomical data are concerned with events occurring close to the horizon, they are especially susceptible to the prevailing
seeing conditions. Dust in the air, fog and slight cloud coverage can easily prevent a successful sighting of a first lunar crescent
or a heliacal rising of a star or a planet. The influence of all these factors and possible ways to deal with them will be presented.
