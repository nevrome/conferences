Presentation Format: Oral
This session will discuss the importance of including a search for the potential use of astronomy in the examination of any culture. It as well explores educational strategies to enable scholars to add astronomical research skills that will enable them to
augment their studies in this pursuit.
Numerous cultures throughout history have employed astronomy in various ways. The night sky has remained essentially unchanged and much can be learned through the study of how astronomy has been viewed and used. Astronomical aspects of a
culture should not be overlooked when overall knowledge can be enhanced by incorporating that societyâ€™s use of astronomy into
the greater understanding.
