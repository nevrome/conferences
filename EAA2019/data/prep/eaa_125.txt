In this introduction, we aim to set the scene and place the session and its papers in the context of both the session’s key text,
Public Archaeology (ed. Nick Merriman), and wider developments in the field since its publication in 2004.
Merriman defines public archaeology as the study of processes and outcomes through which archaeology becomes part of a
wider public culture. Since there is not a single public entity, public archaeology exists in the realm of contestation. Matters of
ethics and identity are at its core, attributes which continue to be fundamental to the discipline and which are evident from this
session’s papers.
As we will hear, public archaeology is more than outreach and dissemination: it is a participatory discipline for the ‘active citizen’.
Access to information, knowledge and education along with technological advances, continue to make the world of archaeology
accessible to the public. While participation is at the heart of public archaeology, tensions between ‘mental’ and ‘physical’ involvement in archaeology, as well as the relationship between the academic ‘expert’ and the layperson, not to mention relations
between indigenous and majority populations.
