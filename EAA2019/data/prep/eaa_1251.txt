astronomically-derived concepts and related practices in societies typically studied by archaeology. While markedly interdisciplinary, archaeoastronomy can thus be considered a constituent part of archaeological pursuit. Relying on both written and
unwritten evidence, including spatial distribution of archaeological vestiges, it explores all cultural manifestations related to the
observation of the sky, as well as their role in subsistence strategies, architectural and urban planning, religion and ritual, and
political ideology. Although frequently focused on astronomical referents of architectural orientations and other alignments embedded in ancient cultural landscapes, archaeoastronomy also seeks to understand the underlying motives within the broader
context of landscape archaeology. By presenting a number of case studies, which should exemplify the problems addressed and
the procedures employed to solve them, this session is intended to illustrate the potential of archaeoastronomy, its relevance
to archaeology, and the place it deserves within a broader framework of anthropological disciplines.
