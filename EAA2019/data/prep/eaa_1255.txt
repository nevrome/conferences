in accordance with astronomic parameters. Numerous texts found at Ḫattuša relate to celestial divination reminiscent of Old
Babylonian astronomical and astrological practices. With this in mind, the purpose of the Hittite rock sanctuary of Yazılıkaya,
adjacent to Ḫattuša, can now be elucidated. The sancturay, first seen by Europeans in 1834, contains over ninety rock-cut reliefs
of deities, humans, animals, and mythical figures dating to the second half of the 13th century BCE. The reliefs in Chamber A are
arranged in groups for the purpose of keeping track of lunar months, the days of a lunar month, and years. By marking the days
and synodic months, the Hittite priests were able to determine when additional months were required to keep lunar and solar
years aligned. The sanctuary’s Chamber B was perfectly set up for use as a star clock to tell the time during the night.
