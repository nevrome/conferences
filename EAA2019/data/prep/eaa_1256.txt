This study aimed to investigate whether the founders of the city at Kerkenes DaÄŸ had deliberately incorporated astronomical
knowledge to their city-planning through orientation analysis of selected buildings, idols, and the city gates. The excavations
result suggested the idea that the whole city was planned in accordance with an ideal urban concept containing all essential
elements of the city placed on strategic locations. Previous studies on Phrygians revealed that there are general orientation
preferences, particularly for the idols representing the Phrygian Goddess Matar, and associated with the city gate which was
often oriented towards the Sun whenever possible. At this research, the city gates, the monumental buildings found at the Palatial Complex, and idols found both at the main gate of the city, Cappadocia Gate, and at the Monumental Entrance of the Palatial
Complex were examined to find out whether there was an intended orientation towards to a particular star, constellations, or
the Sun. Based on the determined threshold value, three meaningful results were obtained: the Ashlar Building and the Audience
Hall appeared connected with the star Altair; the Structure A with the Hadar; and the North-East Gate with the summer solstice.
Further analysis including other Phrygian sites is necessary in order to make credible interpretation, nevertheless, the direction
of the Structure A towards the rising point of Hadar on the horizon could be interpreted as a reflection of the Thracian influence
on the Phrygian culture as in southern -eastern Bulgaria a large number of dolmens and tombs were oriented towards to the
Southern Cross and the Pointers (Hadar).
