Menorca. Taulas, exclusive of Menorca, are oriented towards the southern quadrant of the horizon, with just one major exception,
Torralba d’en Salort. In addition, each taula enclosure was placed so that it would have a perfect view of the southern horizon
(Hoskin, Temples, tombs and their orientations, 2001). Presumably, these facts had religious purposes.
Interestingly, Menorca landscapes are also home to another type of construction called ‘barraques’, which were built in the 19th
century for agricultural purposes and look like small dry-limestone ziggurats. According to local still living traditions, barraques
were oriented to avoid the dominant wind from the north, the disturbing ‘tramontana’. However, their orientation pattern slightly
diverts towards the southeast, suggesting the use of a common 19th century technology for orienting purposes.
Back to the taulas, the optimal vision of the stellar asterism formed by the Southern Cross and Alfa and Beta Centauri, along
the main axis of the monument, would allow orienting taulas towards the south, and would also explain the need for an open and
clear southern horizon. Besides, due to Equinox precession, most of these stars ceased to be visible in later centuries, perhaps
leading to a gradual abandonment of the taula sanctuaries in Roman times. Hence, Talayotic people would have used the best
instrument on hand of their epoch, the sky, to achieve their needs.
