In this paper focus on what we consider some of the main contributions posed by Merriman´s seminal edited volume Public
Archaeology (2004), as well as of the work of some of the Latinamerican Social Archaeologists (LSA) of the 1970´s and 1980’s.
We will discuss the posterior developments of these main contributions during the last decades, as well as its main limitations
and failures.
We will also present our own experience with a project of public education and archaeology in the Comuna de Taltal, in the hyperarid coast of northern Chile. We will discuss how this work builds on the contributions of both Merriman and LSA, and how it
has attempted to avoid what we consider limitations and pitfalls of these apporaches, trying to propose a way forward towards
a critical public archaeology engaged in social transformation in effective and measurable ways.
The project has used both (our) academic and local non-academic knowledge about local territory, prehistory, history, heritage
and current social practices and identities, to develop pedagogical units that are adapted to the formal requirements of the
national educational system but which achieve the stipulated learning outcomes through engagement with local referents. We
have also developed the didactical material to implement those units in two pre-school and two school leves and implemented
the units in three public schools of the city of Taltal.
Both the pedagogical units and the didactical material were developd through a transdisciplinary experience including professionals from the social sciences, Education as well as local teachers. The strategy and outcomes of the project take Merriman´s
and ASL´s contribution a step forward, showing a difficult though succesful case of a critical public archaeology in a contemporary Latinamerican context.
