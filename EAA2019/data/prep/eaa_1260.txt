BRONZE AGE ROCK ART AND 20TH-CENTURY OIL-ON-CANVAS IMPRESSIONS OF CONSTELLATION
CRUX, THE SOUTHERN CROSS

Presentation Format: Oral
I present and analyse images of cross-like configurations allegedly identified with the constellation Crux that were found among
petroglyphs in the Valle Hermoso (Argentina) and in the Mercantour National Park in southern France.
A similar analysis was also done for two paintings featuring Crux, made by one artist in the 1970s at the La Silla Observatory in
Chile.
The comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that strengthens what Clive Ruggles explained at the Oxford IX International
Symposium on Archaeoastronomy (2011): ”that examples abound of attempts to draw a connection between spatial configurations on the ground, but that ‘literal’ (in the Western sense) representations of constellations in the layout of cupules is problematic because of the apparent lack of cultural precedents”.
The availability of two directly accessible oil-on-canvas impressions of a same constellation by the same artist - created less
than one year apart - emphasizes a necessary key element that must be taken into account in any interpretation: that we always
deal with artwork and with artists, and that we just cannot probe the intentions of an artist, not even after half a century.
Archaeologists work with physical remains with limited information content. Linking images from the past to our modern world
is a difficult undertaking, and tying in celestial icons requires additional picture elements, such as alignments or depictions of
self-evident celestial bodies like the Moon. In addition, the time or era of creation of the artwork, the image scale and orientation, the commensurateness of the depicted asterism’s geometric form with the one we see today, and its completeness – i.e.,
a match of the number of stars – should be taken into account. An overall numerical alikeness, or similarity of appearance of an
asterism and a rock-art creation can never be sufficient evidence for unambiguous designation or identification.
