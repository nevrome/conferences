In a number of studies concerned with Mesoamerican architecture and urbanism, it has been argued that the spatial distribution
of buildings and architectural complexes of different types and functions, specifically their relative placement with respect to
the cardinal directions, reflects cosmological concepts. The archaeoastronomical investigations carried out in recent decades
have provided additional information in this regard, revealing that the civic and ceremonial buildings were largely oriented on the
basis of astronomical and calendrical considerations and that these criteria, notwithstanding regional and temporal variations in
orientation patterns, were fundamentally the same over extensive areas and during long periods. One fact that has received less
attention is that the astronomical alignments materialized in the most important buildings frequently conditioned their spatial
relationships and were also reproduced, although approximately and without being observationally functional, in extensive sectors of the built environment. Several specific cases that will be discussed exemplify this practice, showing that it is precisely
the importance of the astronomically significant directions that allows us to understand some clearly recognizable aspects of
prehispanic urban layouts, and even of broader cultural landscapes, which have partly been preserved to the present day.
