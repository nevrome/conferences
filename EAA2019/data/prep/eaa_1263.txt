transcended at least until the arrival of the Spaniards. In fact, they were the ones who originated the calendar and assigned it an
unprecedented utility.
In Mexico we have archaeological zones that cover from the year 2,500 BC until at least 900 AD, as well as documents from the
ethnohistorical times, from the XVII century, and with ethnographies of Mixezoquean and Mayanse populations that allow us to
make some analogies with the relationship that exists between the mountains, the Sun and the ancient traces and the concepts
of the soul and the human body as well as the personhood. In the introduction it will be shown how it is a millenary tradition that
can be track down with the methods and techniques of Cultural Astronomy, specifically with Archaeoastronomy.
The development of the presentation will focus on the Archaeological Zone of Malpasito, Tabasco, surely designed and built between 600 and 900 AD. We will know a spatio-temporal planning that corresponds to materialised concepts in which terrestrial
and celestial elements come into harmony, such as the mountains and the Sun. The aspects of astronomy and orientation that
will come into play will be: the equinox, the circumsolstitial region, the axis of 21Â° and the solar and non-solar mountain. Finally,
we will see how it is possible that the explanation can make use of tools, in addition to archaeoastronomical, ethnological, as the
one of the hidden face of the pleat of Pitarch.
