This paper focuses on the presentation of some examples of Ancient Pueblo culture sites dated to the thirteenth century A.D.
with rock art panels located in four canyons of the Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, southwestern Colorado, USA
which might have been connected with astronomical observations, beliefs and ceremonial systems. There are at least six of
forty five sites analyzed so far that could have been seasonal, solar or lunar markers and ceremonies and rituals connected to
them. The project research also includes documentation of rock art panels and their connection to the settlement structure and
landscape features like mesas and mountain ranges.
At one of these sites, located in Sand Canyon, direct observations were conducted during the summer and winter solstices of
2018. The rock art panel at the site consists of geometric depictions, mainly three spirals that prominent on the panel center and
over 30 deeply engraved notches, grooves and ovals that make up the bulk of the panel. Especially promising are observations
of sunlight-shadow interactions with the rock art panel during and after the winter solstice that may mark the beginning of the
winter solstice ceremonial period well known from the ethnographic literature of Hopi and Zuni, the direct descendant groups
of Ancient Pueblo people. Some Hopi representatives were also consulted about rock are panels in the field in 2016 and 2017.
This research is a part of the project that has been conducted since 2011 by the Institute of Archaeology, Jagiellonian University
in Krakow, Poland in cooperation with several American institutions: Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and the Canyons of the
Ancients National Monument (a branch of the Bureau of Land Management), Colorado, and the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office
in Arizona.
