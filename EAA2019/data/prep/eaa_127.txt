PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY APPROACH IN MUSEUM COMMUNICATION IN NAPLES (SOUTHERN ITALY):
PROBLEMS AND NEW PERSPECTIVES
Author(s): De Vivo, Caterina (Progetto Museo)
Presentation Format: Oral
In the last few years Italian Archaeological Communication had a terrific development and now, many museums seem to apply
real audience oriented policies. In this paper, after a short review of the important changes that happened in the last ten years,
and of the theoretical debates that is now going on in the country (e.g. are now museums audience oriented just to earn more
money and funds?), the results of an important project carried out in the Archaeological Museum of Naples with the Chinese
community will be presented. The project was aimed at re-thinking communication material for the Museum that was specifically
conceived to present the archaeological heritage to the Chinese culture audience. Although, projects aimed at developing a real
intercultural museum communication have been carried out in many European countries in the last decades, this approach was
still very new for the city of Naples where Classical archaeological communication has mostly always had an aesthetic approach
(Shanks & Tilley,1992). The presentation of the results of this project will be the occasion to share some theoretical thoughts on
the development of a Public Archaeological Approach in the museum communication in Italy.
