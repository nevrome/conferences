and Knowth, nearby Dublin, could be representations of variable time periods and cyclical processes. To test this hypothesis, we
reconsider with an openminded attitude how Neolithic people could possibly have represented such abstract notions. We find
that spirals are the most natural representations of cycles and that an increase followed by a decrease of a time period such as
daylight over a year can be simply represented by a filled triangle or lozenge. It suggests that these three common motifs of Irish
megalithic art are all linked to the representation of time. It would explain the association of spirals with series of triangles or lozenges on all three richly decorated kerbstones of Newgrange. In particular, on the entrance stone of the passageway illuminated
by the rising sun on the winter solstice. This work strengthens the case of our earlier result that five of the most complex Irish
spiral motifs are very likely calendrical representations. Indeed, their specific design reflects up to five manifestations of the sun
and the moon over months and seasons, which could have been easily identified by Neolithic observers.
