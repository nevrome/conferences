THE ETRUSCAN TEMPLES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA RELATED TO THEIR
ORIENTATION
Author(s): Pernigotti, Antonio Paolo (Universit√† degli Studi di Milano)
Presentation Format: Poster
In the Spring of 2013 a series of field campaigns were started aimed at measuring azimuths and, where possible, the horizon
heights, of 28 Etruscan sacred structures (so as to verify the previous samples present in Prayon 1991 and Aveni-Romano
1994). The results achieved in this work (Pernigotti 2019) led to the hypothesis that the orientation of Etruscan temples was
determined by the movement of the Sun, with a clear preference for that sky arc where the Sun never rises or sets but where it
goes through every day of the year, lighting up the front of the sacred structures for multiple hours a day. Starting from these
results, the goal of the first part of this contribution will be to focus on a more specific analysis of the collected data, concerning
the distribution of the orientations, to proceed, in the second part, to a comparison with those concerning both the temples
of the Greek cities of Sicily and Magna Graecia (Aveni-Romano 2000; Salt 2009; Hannah-Magli-Orlando 2017), and the sacred
buildings of the Samnite centers (Ruggeri 2010). This comparison will allow us to identify similarities and differences, regarding
temple orientation, between the Etruscan tradition and those of two populations geographically and culturally close to the communities of Etruria. Finally, in the last part of the contribution, through an interdisciplinary approach that combines data from
the archaeological, epigraphic and literary record to those of archaeoastronomy, it will try to return, in the light of the analysis
of the data and comparisons made, both on the reasons that may have determined the general distribution of the orientation of
Etruscan temples, both on the motivations and the factors that may have influenced the orientations of the single structures.
