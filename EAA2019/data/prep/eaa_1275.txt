The Pergusa Lake, near Enna, one of the few natural lakes present today in Sicily, is the place where it was placed by many authors
of the classical world (e.g. Aristotle, Diodorus Siculus and Ovid) the “kidnapping of Persephone”, one of the most fascinating episodes of ancient mythology. The Lake is characterized by a particular ecosystem and by a singular phenomenon that sporadically
leads to a reddening of the waters, an event that probably also impressed our ancestors to the point of considering it a mythical
place. A short distance from the lake, in the North direction, there are a series of hills, among which Cozzo Matrice stands out,
where there is a vast archaeological area consisting of the remains of an indigenous village with annexed necropolis, sacred
buildings and a very suggestive natural cave, probably destined to religious activities.
The Cozzo Matrice site is in visual contact with the Pergusa Lake to the south, and to the northwest with the town of Enna, where
there is the so-called ‘Ceres Rock’ (about 1000 masl), from where you can enjoy a 360° breathtaking view. In this area was located the most important shrine dedicated to Demeter in the Greek era, and then to Ceres in Roman times. Cicero, for example,
described with minute detail the presence in this place of two colossal statues ”ante aedem Cereris in open ac propatulo loco”:
one represented Ceres, bearing a statue of Victory on the right hand, the other Triptolemus.
Attended without interruption for millennia, today the Ceres Rock shows several carvings in the rock, in part probably attributable to the important sacred area.
The study illustrated here presents the analysis of the two archaeological sites (Ceres Rock and Cozzo Matrice) from the point of
view of the landscape: terrestrial and celestial (skyscape).
