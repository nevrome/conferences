period between 9 B.C.E - 40 CE.
The zodiac sign was carved on the side of the tomb, along with two snakes and an eagle, two very widespread mythological symbols associated with the worship of the sun in the Nabatean religion. Although the carving of a fish in the middle of the desert is
highly uncommon, similar images of sea nature are evident in Nabataean art. A female bust from the temple at Khirbet al-Tannur,
found crowned with two fish on top of her head is an example. Another is the two fish figures representing Pisces among the
zodiac signs found at Khirbet al-Dharih in Jorden.
The Nabateans have centralized in a location within many of the richest civilizations at that time. Their proficiency to mix and
blend with foreign civilizations, while still Preserving their own traditional culture led to their wealth, prosperity, knowledge and
independence. This enabled them to last for hundreds of years much longer than other Near Eastern kingdoms. Nabateans excelled in many aspects of life, but in this paper archaeological records are presented from an Archaeoastronomical perspective,
to emphasize the Nabataeans relationship with the sky, and to demonstrate the potential of Archaeoastronomy and its relevance to archaeology.
