Presentation Format: Oral
The construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric plant at the brazilian amazon was and still is a very complex and controversial
process in history and politics of Brazil. A project of archaeological heritage management was developed to research about the
archaeological potential of the flood area. These research ensured that a preventive archaeology program was established. In
between 2010 and 2015 was discovered an important part of the history of Amazonian peoples by the identification of more
than 159 archaeological sites. The institution responsible for the archaeological material´s custody is the House of Culture of
Marabá. However the space is not yet ready to receive it and the city is not part of the area hit by the flood. The populations
affected by the enterprise will not have easy access to the archaeological remains found. With a role almost irrelevant in the
project and with little interaction with the local community, would it have been possible to have a public archaeology approach
before, during and after this project? This public archaeology approach could be associated with the already existence heritage
education programme? The archaeologists should have been more conscious about their the political and ethical responsibility
with the archaeological heritage discovered, and mostly with the citizens? The public archaeology could be use to improve the
relationship of local population with their archaeological heritage? The purpose of this communication is to try to establish a
political and conceptual reflection on how public archaeology would be applied on this situation in every aspect.
