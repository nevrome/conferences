EASTERN JUTLAND, DENMARK

Metallurgy in Scandinavia was previously unknown until the Bronze Age. Fragments of a crucible and a possible nozzle found in
a secure Neolithic context provide evidence of copper metallurgy in Scandinavia at least 1500 years earlier. The crucible was
found at Lønt near Haderslev in eastern Jutland, Denmark. The technical ceramics were situated in a cultural layer containing
early Neolithic Funnel Beaker pottery dating from around 3800 – 3500 BC and situated beneath four megalithic tombs providing
an ante quem date of 3300 – 3100 BC. The presence of a copper alloy in the crucible is confirmed by three independent X-ray fluorescence analyses using both a hand-held and a stationary instrument, SEM-EDS analysis of a cross-section as well as a Bruker
Tornado µ-X-Ray-fluorescence scanner (µ-XRF). The transmission of metallurgy to southern Scandinavia seems to be part of
supra-regional networks introducing other phenomena like long barrows, causewayed enclosures, two-aisled houses and certain
types of artefacts that enabled the establishment of a fully Neolithic society. The presence of local know how in heat treatment
of metal also raises questions of the role in society of the smiths as well as the copper artefacts.
