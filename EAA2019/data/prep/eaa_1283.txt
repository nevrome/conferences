Here we present new radiocarbon results sampled from the Marne region of France, and focus on the implications of results
obtained from recent excavations at the site of Vert la Gravelle, directed by Rémi Martineau. We find that where measured by
radiocarbon, most activity at these Neolithic sites overlaps in time, although mining activity at the Neolithic site of Vert-la-Gravelle starts significantly earlier. We highlight where OxCal and CalPal radiocarbon calibration models are in agreement, and explain
the key differences between these analytical techniques. We then shed new light on the temporal relationship between mining
activity, and the hypogeum based burial activity within the mines themselves. In the light of new results from the Leverhulme
Trust funded Neomine project based at the Institute of Archaeology University College London https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neomine/
we discuss the economic implications of this activity, in the context of wider patterns of settlement and exchange in the sur-
