Excellent preservation conditions in wetland sites located in the circum-Alpine area allow studying plant material in detail. We
measured flax seeds from 40 Neolithic wetland sites, in order to identify if this useful plant (Linum usitatissimum) was cultivated
for the purpose of oil and/or fibre extraction. Today specialized varieties exist: a big-seeded flax that is used for oil production
and a small-seeded flax for fibre production. The results of the measurements of the ancient flax seeds clearly show a change in
size around 3500 BC. The change in seed size was detected in both proxies, the uncharred and the charred flax seeds.
This result matches perfectly with the observation that in the archaeological context textile tools increased in number and variety during the 4th millennium BC as well. We therefore hypothesize that a new breed of flax was introduced into the Alpine region
and that this new fibre crop boosted the production of new items made of flax. However, the question when and where the fibre
flax was developed is still unknown. We tested if textile tools might answer this question. Large datasets of spindle whorls from
two wetland sites in Southern Germany and Switzerland were analysed and the results were compared with a dataset from East
Central European sites. The results indicate that thread production in the Alpine area was practiced by indigenous people and
most probably also by a group of people belonging to a different socio-cultural background. In our lecture we want to discuss the
possibility that immigrants introduced the new flax breed together with a new textile technology.
