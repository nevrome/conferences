Within the CRC1266 “Scales of Transformations: Human-Environmental Interaction in prehistoric and archaic societies” continuities and discontinuities of societies e.g. of the northern European plain are analysed in respect to social transformation.
Beside global triggers of change, local and regional mosaics of transformations and translations describe the active role, humans played in transformation processes of the 4th millennium BCE. Events, processes and structures are visible
•
in the adaption and non-adaption of copper metallurgy as a social technology;
•
in the construction of cooperative societies as a result of agrarian innovations,
•
and in the creation of individuality as a result of political separation within small communities.
In our model the continued subsistence economy (slow food) forms the base for rapid reactions on innovative potentials from
outside and inside of the societies (fast changes). The hypothesis are verified both in northern Loess areas (Central Germany:
Baalberge to Corded Ware), and in the northern and western moraine landscapes (TRB).
