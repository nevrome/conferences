As a result of the growth of large-scale rescue excavations, it is now possible to put forward two distinct sequences in the considered area through ceramic styles. In the North, mainly in Lower Alsace, the Michelsberg culture appears at the end of the fifth
millennium BC. One of its most distinctive features are undecorated round-bottom ceramic shapes whose origin can be traced
back to the West (Paris Basin). The Michelsberg is later followed by several stylistic stages more specific to the Upper Rhine
and the Neckar Valley (Munzingen B and C), which can be compared to the Pfyn ceramic vessels of Eastern Switzerland. After
3600 BC, the documentation is lacking. Some rare finds can however be linked with the ceramic productions of the Paris Basin,
especially the Seine-Oise-Marne culture.
The South is less affected by Michelsberg influences, but is by contrast inspired by the pottery styles of the western Swiss
Plateau (Cortaillod culture). Therefore, another stylistic group of indigenous origin appears at the beginning of the forth millennium from the Kaiserstuhl hills to the Mulhouse urban area: the Munzingen A. From 3300 BC onwards and after a short gap in the
sequence, a pottery style native from the Swiss Plateau takes over from the Munzingen: the Horgen culture.
The aim of this paper is to itemize this timeline through the example of the most recent field discoveries. The historic meaning
of these stylistic changes will be also enquired, by broadening the reflection to the funerary practices and the pottery making
techniques.
