SPARKING JOY: MARIE KONDO AND THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY

Presentation Format: Oral
The success of the bestselling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing and
the recent television programme Tidying Up With Marie Kondo has brought the ideas of Marie Kondo to a global audience, to the
extent that she was named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time in 2015. While Kondo’s book focuses mainly
on tidying and decluttering one’s home, specifically by discovering which objects ‘spark joy’, I would argue that there are also a
number of lessons for public archaeology.
In this paper, I will look at how the KonMari method can inspire archaeology and heritage management. For Kondo, change in the
status of objects is obvious and natural; this aligns with contemporary ideas of heritage as mutable. This is particularly relevant
for how we deal with practical policy in the form of ‘listing’ and conservation, especially in terms of built heritage. Furthermore,
the concept of ‘sparking joy’ is somewhat transferable to current discourses relating to deaccessioning and ‘decluttering’ museum collections. Linked to this, an embrace of the KonMari method is a means to increase public engagement with archaeology
by returning power to the public and allowing people to determine what ‘sparks joy’; power would be moved from the anonymous
‘expert’ to the public, and the heritage professional would become one of many interested actors rather than the sole arbiter of
what is correct.
