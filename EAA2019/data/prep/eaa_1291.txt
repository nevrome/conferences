The presentation is trying to shed light on supraregional entanglements beyond the borders of the scholarly defined “cultural
entities”. For this purpose, a practice theoretical approach is chosen. Accordingly, pottery making actors are not just „adopting“
new styles and techniques but are modifying and renegotiating them depending on what they have already learned.
Methodologically speaking several widespread stylistic and technical pottery features are chosen based on their frequent occurrence in Southern Germany and the neighboring areas. In a next step a detailed analysis of the local pottery production of
some showcase sites is performed to see how these supraregional features are copied, modified or declined in local pottery
practices.
In this way a richly textured picture emerges which is not one of sharply bounded „cultural areas“ but one of personal mobility and
different negotiation processes within local and regional “communities of practice”.
It is argued that in the early 3rd Millennium BC a dense cultural network connected communities between South Western Germany in the west and Lower Austria in the east. The characteristic pottery features were not accepted everywhere in the same
way and cultural peculiarities of the fourth millennium are persisting in some regions. Nonetheless communities participating in
this network started to change. Frequent finds of cord decorated pottery sherds on sites of the so called “regional groups” of
the early 3rd Millennium BC raise the question if this network even facilitated the spread of subsequent large-scale phenomena
like the “Corded Ware Culture”.
