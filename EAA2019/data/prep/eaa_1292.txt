THE 3RD MILLENNIUM BC – A VIEW FROM FRANCONIA

The established archaeological map of the late 4th and early 3rd millennium is characterized by numerous cultural groups, most
of them quite regionally confined if compared to the larger-scale entities of the Younger Neolithic. However, common elements
of material culture can be traced across most of these regional groups and clear distinctions or delimitations are hard to be
made. A closer look also reveals substantial gaps in the picture: archaeological data is virtually absent from some regions. The regionalized character of the Late Neolithic rather seems to be a product of research history than a reflection of prehistoric reality.
Franconia (northern Bavaria/northern Wuerttemberg) is one of the regions with only scarce evidence for the period in question.
Some recent excavations however - especially at the hill-top settlement of Burgerroth - give new information. Close similarities
in material culture with neighboring regions in the south (Goldberg III), east (Cham, Řivnač) as well as in the north (Bernburg, Wartberg) raise questions concerning inter-regional connections and cultural relations, which inevitably lead to some basic considerations on the nature of archaeological ‘groups’ in the Late Neolithic. Surprisingly, Late Neolithic elements seem to be present
until the mid-3rd millennium and associated finds of Corded Ware settlement pottery point to parallel existence of regional Late
Neolithic traditions and Final Neolithic innovations.
