Various distinctive phases of economic and social transformations have been identified in northern Germany and southern
Scandinavia during the 4th millennium B.C. These include phenomena such as neolithization and the building of monumental
architecture in the form of megalithic tombs. The socio-cultural developments and changes associated with these phenomena
are related to different forms of intensive use of the natural surroundings as well as to quantitative and qualitative changes in
material culture.
While the first half of the 4th millennium B.C. was characterised by the beginning of landscape structuring by non-megalithic
long-mounds and sporadic arable farming, stronger and more diverse phenomena can be observed in its second half. These include a boom in megalithic tomb building, an increasing opening of the landscape, and the introduction of important technological impulses like the ard. At the transition to the 3rd millennium B.C., these phenomena began to dissolve and new forms of expression developed. Altogether, these phenomena can be observed in different manifestations and on different spatial scales.
This talk presents the results of diachronic quantitative analyses from a subproject of the Collaborative Research Center ”Scales
of Transformation” (CRC1266) related to the 4th millennium B.C. in northern Germany with a focus on the southern Cimbrian peninsula. The aim of the presentation is to describe different phenomena of transformations and to identify possible triggers and
effects of socio-cultural changes in neolithic societies.
