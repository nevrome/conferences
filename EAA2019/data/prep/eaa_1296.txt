According to the paleosoil researches at the settlements and barrows in the period of 3800-3300 cal. BC in the territory of the
Volga-Ural interfluve the aridization of the climatic situation occurred. The beginning of this period coincides with formation of
the Pit-Grave (Yamnaya) culture. The materials of the early stage of the Pit-Grave culture show many signs of continuity from the
Hvalynsk and Samara cultures of the Eneolithic era. But there are significant changes in economy and the spiritual sphere. In the
economy the transition to the nomadic type of cattle breeding and formation of the metallurgical production on the basis of the
Ural copper ore fields is observed. The social inequality is born, which is reflected in the funeral rites. The burials under barrows
of different size are spreading. The special rituals allocate the burials of clergy. Metal products accompany the burials of the
leaders. At the end of the IV millennium BC burials with wooden wheel vehicles appear.
