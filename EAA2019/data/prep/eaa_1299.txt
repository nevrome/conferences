In the course of studies on ceramics from Neolithic wetland sites of the Northern Alpine Foreland dating between 3900-3500
BC (MET-project), several groups of vessels with shiny dark surfaces were distinguished. The hypothesis formed concerning
their production technique is, that the surfaces were polished or burnished before firing in reducing atmosphere at low temperatures (colour due to carbon). In order to establish whether this or other techniques were used, the archaeological ceramics
were analysed by polarisation microscopy, XRD and SEM coupled with XRF-EDS. Macroscopically, the fabrics of the ceramics
showed some differences in colour and zoning pattern. In every instance, however, while signs of compaction were observed on
the outer portion of the sherds under the microscope, no zoning was detected in the chemical and mineralogical compositions
