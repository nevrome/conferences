THE CROSS AND THE HAMMER: EVIDENCE FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF PAGANISM IN CHRISTIANIZED ICELAND
Author(s): Cartwright, Rachel (University of Minnesota)
Presentation Format: Oral
The conversion of Iceland to Christianity is dated to the year 1000 AD with a vote held at the Althing. This led to many changes
in the ways people were supposed to act especially with regards to the exposure of children, the consumption of horse meat,
and burial practices. As one would expect the conversion of an entire country did not happen overnight with material and literary
evidence indicating the continuance of some pagan beliefs, some of which can still be seen today (e.g. the belief in elves). This
continuance of pagan beliefs can be seen in religiously ambiguous objects, such as the cross/hammer amulets that have been
found throughout Iceland and Scandinavia. This paper will discuss the archaeological evidence that exists in Iceland for the continuation of non-Christian beliefs and practices in the long eleventh century. In addition to the archaeology, literary sources will
also be discussed, as they provide further context for the material remains. Rather than a revolution in religious practices, the
data suggest hybrid notions and performances during the long eleventh century.
