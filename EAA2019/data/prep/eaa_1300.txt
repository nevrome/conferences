from surface to core. This strengthened the hypothesis that the sheen was achieved by polishing alone and that no coatings
were applied.
This was further tested by several experimental firings of small tiles and vessels. The test samples were prepared from different
raw materials collected around studied sites and partially polished in the leather hard state. Some were simply placed in an open
bonfire. The others were covered by a large earthenware pot together with wood shavings and the fire built around in order to
maintain a reducing atmosphere throughout the firing including the cooling phase. Firing temperatures measured by thermocouples placed in different positions reached 950°C in the open bonfire, 650°C under the large pot. In both types of firings,
temperatures were held over 600°C for only about 30 minutes. Sherds matching the archaeological samples in colour, fabric
and surface sheen were the result. As expected, shiny surfaces comparable to the archaeological sherds were obtained only on
polished sections of the vessels and tiles; best results were achieved under completely reducing conditions.
