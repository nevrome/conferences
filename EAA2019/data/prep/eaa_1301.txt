The development of the Funnel Beaker culture (FBC) in the south-eastern Poland (Lesser Poland) had lasted for about 1000
years: 3900-2900 BC. In the earlier stage of this period, i.e. from about 3500 BC, the influences of the Baden complex could
be observed in the culture (in Boleráz stage and further Early Classic stage), coming from the south, from the area of today’s
Moravia and south-western Slovakia. Over the next 200 years or so, these influences intensified and as a result they considerably changed the FBC. The presence of the Baden traits is so significant that the culturally mixed assemblages are called the Funnel Beaker-Baden assemblages (FB-B). Their development dates back to the period between 3400-2900/2800 BC. Regardless
of the cultural influences of the Baden complex on the FBC, in the western part of Lesser Poland the enclave of the settlement
of the proper Baden culture (Late Classic phase) was established. Its origin is connected with a direct migration of human groups
from the Carpathian Basin, whilst the development of the settlement took place between 3100-2900 BC. These two Lesser Poland Eneolithic units – the FB-B and the Baden culture occupied neighbouring areas. In the classical evaluation of the relationship
between the two, the view of the co-existence prevails, which is also indicated by the radiocarbon dating. But do all archaeological data suggest such chronological order? The issue will be tackled in our presentation.
