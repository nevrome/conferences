Presentation Format: Poster
At the westernmost part of Europe, the Lisbon region is an elongated narrow strip of land located, encompassing highly differentiated physical and human landscapes. Flanked by the river Tagus basin on the East and by the Atlantic Ocean on the West,
presents a geologic favoured a solid preservation of organic matter, a feature that turned the Estremadura into a key area for
understanding aspects of ancient peasant societies in Iberia.
The archaeological research in the Lisbon region dates back to the 19th century, having then been identified most of the megalithic tombs and fortified prehistoric Chalcolithic settlements. More recently, early Neolithic contexts have been identified and
excavated indicating early neolithisation (mid 6th millennium). The available information allows a diachronic analysis of the evolution of peasant societies from the 6th to the 3rd millennium. In the middle of the 4th millennium, Late Neolithic, a very rapid
change happens in the patterns of settlement and technology, but it is in funerary practices that the greatest changes occur,
with the advent of the first megalithic funeral practices.
The main changes attested in the 4th millennium will be presented in a long-term perspective, crossing several scales of analysis: the local analysis in a natural region of the Ribeira de Cheleiros (Mafra, Sintra), regional area in the Lisbon region and supra-regional in the Center and South of Portugal.
