Lithic raw materials exploited in mountainous terrains include types such as chert, quartz, rock crystal, quartzites and radiolarite, all of which are suitable for the production of chipped stone artefacts. Although quarries and other procurement locations securely dated to the Mesolithic/Neolithic are rare, analysis of raw material variation at (settlement) sites can be used to
gain insight into the variety and scale of lithic sources exploited. Together, this demonstrates different procurement strategies
throughout the Stone Age. Varying intensities and methods of persisting, seasonal, and event-like exploitation, are probably
closely related to general landscape use, climatic conditions, mobility patterns, and various social contexts.
What does lithic raw material procurement in the montane and (sub-)alpine zones tell us about Mesolithic and Neolithic economies or social organisation? What was the social significance of these lithic raw materials, these “cloudstones” as commented
on by Edmonds and Ferraby (2013)? What can apparent familiarity with perhaps otherwise largely unchanged, natural places
reveal about social aspects of these various communities? Did limited access to specific raw materials influence technological
developments? There are many gaps in our knowledge, and we invite speakers to explore these with us through case studies or
syntheses.
