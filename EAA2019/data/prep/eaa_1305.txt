Both archaeology as well as art and poetry try to understand what it is to be human. In their book ”Stonework” and by introducing the term ”cloudstones”, Mark Edmonds and Rose Ferraby (2013) demonstrate how closely related the two main qualities of
stone raw materials, and act and location of extraction can be. Socio-political and aesthetic qualities of stone on the one hand,
and the stones’ functional aspects as well as the choices made concerning lithic raw material extraction on the other are often
intertwined. During the last 150 years, the interest in quarries and raw material extraction has shifted from trying to determine
the (prehistoric) origins of quarry sites to include both extraction activities and the distribution of the extracted material, as well
as the socio-political role of these quarries and raw materials. Recently, more elusive and spiritual qualities of lithic raw materials
have also come to the fore.
In this introduction, we will briefly introduce these central themes of research into raw material extraction and use in the Mesolithic and Neolithic in mountainous landscapes through its research history. We will then place the contributions within the
context of this framework and this session.
