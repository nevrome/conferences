The Lærdal Mountain plateau is situated 1100-1500 masl in Southern Norway. Geographically the drainage divide between east
and west runs in this area and this highland also represents the border between Eastern and Western Norway. The area is well
known for its large reindeer herds and good hunting ground. A vast number of Stone Age sites together with quarries and outcrops of quartzite have been detected here. Since the 1960s the University Museum of Bergen has conducted numerous excavations in this area, seven in the last ten years. The investigations indicate varying intensities in use of this landscape through
time. In this paper we use three different sets of data to shed new light on the dynamics and utilization of the mountain sites:
•
Radiocarbon dates and site studies from Lærdal.
•
Demographic big data proxies from the coast of Western Norway based on 6-700 radiocarbon dates from the Mesolithic and the Neolithic.
•
Climate studies based on variability in glacial activity and vegetation history during the Holocene.
A primary goal is to compare demographic fluctuations detected at the coast and variations in the utilization of the mountain
resources. Finally we will discuss why people sought this alpine area in the first place.
