to be transported into the mountains. It is understandable to find flint in regions with a restricted range of locally available and
suitable rock types, but why do we find flint in regions rich in “flint alternatives”?
Focusing on two case studies, we will examine procurement practices in different parts of the mountain plateaus of West-Norway. The first deals with quarrying activity and the distribution of crystal quartz within the upland interior of Rogaland County,
a region where flint is by far the most commonly utilized rock. Moving north of the Hadangervidda plateau, a second case study
examines the exploitation and distribution of fine-grained quartzite from two large quarries situated c.1300 m.a.s.l. in Lærdal
and Hemsedal, at the watershed between Sogn og Fjordane and Hemsedal Counties.
Variations in quarrying practices and the distribution and frequency of raw materials can, when contextualised, widen our understanding of developments in the use of different landscapes, resources, and mobility patterns in the Mesolithic and Neolithic
periods. These insights allow us to consider the more intangible aspects of Stone Age lifeways including ontological questions
concerning the “charisma of things” and human/rock/place relationships.
