A distinctive feature of the Neolithic in the Shetland Islands, off the north coast of Britain is the dominance of a single geological
source, riebeckite felsite, for the production of stone axes and also Shetland knives. Since 2013 the North Roe Felsite Project
has been using an integrated, multi-scalar approach to investigate the character of the quarry complex and its wider role in Neolithic society in Shetland.
The quarry fits into the category of lithic procurement strategies being examined in this session as it is situated in northwest
Mainland, the highest part of the Shetland archipelago. While the highest point, Ronas Hill, is only 450m high, because of the island location and climatic conditions this is equivalent to much higher mainland mountainous areas on the mainland. The sub-artic climatic conditions would have had an influence on quarrying and procurement strategies.
It appears that the quarry was in use for over a millennium (from before 3,500- 2,500 BC) - the duration of the Neolithic in Shetland. Evidence from the quarry complex indicates that extraction was embedded in ritualized extraction processes and that the
quarry landscape was developed as a special place. Our focus is now turning to the wider role of the quarry in the establishment
and development of Neolithic society in Shetland.
