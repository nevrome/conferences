A GLIMPSE INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL OF HERITAGE MANAGEMENT
Author(s): van den Dries, Monique (Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University) - Schreurs, Jose (State Agency for Cultural Heritage)
Presentation Format: Oral
A prime motivation in public archaeology and heritage management, is passing the memories of the past on to future generations. It is an objective that can be found in many ‘old’ and new (international) heritage policies, as cultural heritage and the
memories attached to it are deemed significant for individuals’ and groups’ identity, both in the present and in the future. Most
heritage professionals still seem to believe in this objective, it is hardly ever questioned. At the same time, there is no evidence
that we pay much (actual) attention to those we wish to bequeath, to their values and interests. Looking at future directions
in Public Archaeology, should we not particularly consider the future? In this paper, the authors will reflect upon contemporary
archaeological heritage management practices, in particular national monument selections, from the perspective of Public Archaeology and possible interests of future generations. We will discuss how we may complete the holistic approach by also
thinking of involving the interest and values of the community of those we wish to bequeath.
