Seeking for rock crystal, or “Strahlen” has a tradition reaching back many centuries in the central Swiss Alps. Although the use
of rock crystal for artefact production in the region during the Neolithic and Mesolithic has been known for some decennia, the
actual remains of rock crystal extraction have remained extremely rare here as well as in in the rest of the Alps. Near the mountain pass “Fuorcla da Strem sut”, such an extraction site was discovered after it melted free from the Brunnifirn glacier in 2013.
Organic finds from the site were dated to the very end of the Mesolithic. The site puts the assemblages of rock crystal artefacts
of the region in a new light. Furthermore, it provides insights into hunter-gatherer and early agropastoralist habitation of and
raw material use in the subalpine and alpine zones. These can subsequently be compared with other parts of the Swiss (Pre-)
Alps where we have some knowledge of raw material use. Lastly, it allows new insights into past and present glacial and climatic
changes and their impact on hunter-gatherer archaeology as well as procurement archaeology of the (sub-)alpine zones.
