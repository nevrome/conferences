Can we by applying new technology to Mesolithic material trace interaction between sites? Pending on the results, the application of pXRF to compare flint types could lead to establishing relationships between sites and tracking the people who procured,
knapped and used stone tools by tracking movements of the material itself between sites in a certain area. It would also give an
alternative dating to the sites that lack other ways of determining age.
On the shores of Lake Stora Myrvatnet, located approx. 600 m.a.s.l. in Rogaland, Norway, a number of dwelling sites have been
located. These sites are among the earliest documented sites in the country, and a newly discovered Early Mesolithic site at
Lake Stora Myrvatnet expands the previously known settlement complex. Flint is the most dominant raw material, although rock
crystal, quartz and quartzite are represented as well. Most of the raw material procurement would have been from the coastal
shores of Norway, as flint does not appear naturally in the bedrock.
