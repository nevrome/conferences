In order to establish potential relationships between dated and undated sites, as well as demonstrating potential contemporary
settlements around the lake, I have initiated a pilot study of flint. In it, the elemental composition of visually similar looking flint
is compared, making this a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. pXRF analysis will then be initiated on the selected artifacts. Flakes and flake axes from four sites are being examined in the analysis.
Connecting sites at Myrvatnet through raw material analysis will provide new insights into the exploitation of raw materials and
the social organization. Not only within this complex in the mountainous Early Mesolithic environment, but also shed light on
procurement along the western coast of Norway.
