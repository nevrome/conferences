We review archaeological evidence for the earliest obsidian transfers by hunter-gatherers in the Central Andes to explore land
use and mobility during the initial settlement of South America. Despite being relatively small, localized geologic features located within rugged, high-elevation mountain landscapes, Peruâ€™s three major obsidian sources had been discovered and were being
transported long distances by the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene. Early use of mountain obsidian sources is not restricted to the Central Andes but is demonstrated at multiple sites along the western cordilleras of the Americas. The discovery
and use of mountain obsidians therefore appears to have been a regular feature of the early settlement phase of the Americas.
Our least-cost analysis explores possible routes of hunter-gatherer mobility and interaction between obsidian sources and sites
to which obsidians moved via direct acquisition or exchange. Even least-cost transfers suggest travel across considerable topographic relief and high elevations (>4000 m above sea level). These patterns imply that hunter-gatherers were intimately familiar
with high-elevation landscapes and resources by 13,000-12,000 years ago throughout the Central Andean region. Once discovered, use of these resources persisted and amplified throughout the Holocene as enduring markers of long-distance social
connections.
