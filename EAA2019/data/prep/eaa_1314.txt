Prehistoric settlement dynamics in the Alps have become a specific focus of archaeological research. Besides pastoral economy, the diversity of resources available in the high Alps can be considered as one primary factor triggering the colonization of the
Alpine realm. Since the appearance of prehistoric people in the Eastern Alps, they engaged in targeted prospection activities in
search for raw materials. Especially the rich sources of high quality lithic raw materials suitable for chipped stone tool production,
predominantly chert, radiolarite and rock crystal, were used since the Paleolithic and more intensively during Mesolithic and Neolithic times. During the latter, we see the increasing use and exploitation of primary sources, all of which are located in remote
places oftentimes difficult to access.
Recent investigations conducted in the western parts of the Eastern Alps in present-day Austria have demonstrated the potential of this extensive source region for inner alpine resource management strategies during the Stone Ages on various scales,
revealing early procurement spheres, exchange networks and transalpine supply routes. However, although several quarrying
sites of high quality materials have been detected, it appears that East Alpine lithic resources played only a minor role in the
developing raw material supply networks. In this contribution, we will present selected quarrying- and campsites in the Eastern
Alps of Vorarlberg and Tyrol, and attempt an interpretation of the possible underlying economic and societal reasons for this at
first glance rather surprising phenomenon.
