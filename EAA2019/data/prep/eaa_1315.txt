PUBLISHING IN INTERNATIONAL, PEER-REVIEWED ACADEMIC JOURNALS
Theme: Digital archaeology, science and multidisciplinarity: new methods, new challenges
Organisers: Witcher, Robert (Antiquity) - Nilsson Stutz, Liv (Archaeological Dialogues)
Format: Workshop
Publishing in international, peer-reviewed journals can be a challenging process for researchers at all career stages: PhD students, early career researchers and experienced scholars alike. Each journal has different article formats, its own evaluation
criteria and broader objectives in relation to the content that it publishes. Manuscripts submitted for consideration therefore
need to be tailored to the specific requirements and audiences of each target journal. The Editors of Antiquity and Archaeological
Dialogues, Dr Robert Witcher and Dr Liv Nilsson Stutz respectively, will lead a workshop to guide prospective authors through the
publishing process. They will provide insights into each step of the process, including working up initial ideas and structuring articles, the submission, peer review and editorial decision-making processes, and post-acceptance editing, publication, publicity
and metrics. The session will provide practical guidance on how to improve your chances of publication in a selective journal by
avoiding common errors and by taking simple steps to ensure that manuscripts address the key criteria that reviewers are asked
to evaluate. The workshop will include time for questions and answers.
