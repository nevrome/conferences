Presentation Format: Oral
The sulphurous springs of Baden in the Swiss Canton Aargau were for nearly 2000 years the most popular in Switzerland. In
roman times the thermae of Aquae Helveticae welcomed visitors from near and far. From the middle ages to the 17th century
Baden was the most famous spa in the German Empire and visited by kings, queens and the clergy as well as by wealthy citizens
of nearby Zurich and visitors from all over Europe. So to speak, Switzerland’s first touristic hot (s)pot were hot waters at Baden!
The numerous literary sources and the rich historical tradition make Baden an important reference for historians, geographers –
as well as for archaeologists.
The fact that the spa town Baden did not develop to the same extent in the 19th and early 20th centuries as did other spa towns
saved many archaeological remains and historical buildings from undocumented demolition and loss. Between 2009–2012 and
2018, two campaigns of rescue excavations were carried out before the extensive constriction work for a new thermal spa takes
place. These excavations unearthed impressive remains of the roman thermae and the ruins of the medieval and modern baths
before only known by the written sources. The archaeological findings therefore not only prove, precise and illustrate the known
historical facts but they also shine a new light on medieval and early modern bathing culture.
The presentation gives a short introduction to the Baden research project. Then it focuses on the archaeology of the medieval
and modern bathing facilities and the urban development of the spa precinct throughout the second millennium AD.
