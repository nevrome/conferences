Excavations in the last years throw a new light on the spa town of Aachen/Aquae Granni. Covering a surface of approximately
11‘000 square meters, the thermal baths at Aachen were one of the largest in antiquity. In the surroundings of the baths developed one of the largest civil settlements in the southern part of the Germania Inferior.
Archaeological record and an imperial building inscription indicate the existence of a forum. It is possible that Aachen/Aquae
Granni was the capital of a Civitas. In recent years, archaeological evidence proved the continuity of the settlement from Roman
times to the Early Middle Ages.
