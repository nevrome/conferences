In spite of the literary tradition that Charlemagne used the thermal springs (Einhard, Vita Karoli Magni), the archaeological research in this respect is still in its infancy. So is the research on the subsequent bathing activities up into the Early Modern period.
As the knowledge of the appearance of late Roman-medieval Aachen is constantly growing, the meaning and continuity of
Aachenâ€™s baths can be understood. The baths are location factor number one and therefore the reason for the foundation of
the roman settlement and its prosperous urban development as well as for the choice of Aachen as royal and imperial residence
(Pfalz). Aachen was not only the coronation place of German kings but also became one of the most important pilgrimage cities
of the old world.
