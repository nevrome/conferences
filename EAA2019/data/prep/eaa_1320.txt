Presentation Format: Oral
The Roman spa of Lugo is a clear testimony of the history of thermalism as well as of the many vicissitudes witnessed by these
thermal spas over the centuries.
For more than 2000 years its mineral-medicinal waters were exploited and used, whilst different infrastructures were created.
Linked to its historical context, these infrastructures have evolved and transformed the remains of the Roman spa which is still
preserved inside the modern building.
Due to the historical importance of this spa, declared a building of Cultural Interest in 1931, a Master Plan based on interdisciplinary research was drawn up. This project has allowed a deeper understanding of the historical evolution of this building. The
archaeological documentation has been completed with other studies carried out by specialists in such diverse areas as hydrogeology, medicine, anthropology and architecture, which has allowed a diachronic analysis of this complex. Consequently, the
patrimonial heritage of this spa has been enhanced, showing the importance these waters had in the immediate surroundings.
In this presentation we will put forward some of the results from this experience, focusing our proposal on the lines of work developed over the last years to integrate and understand both this and other spas in the context of European thermal heritage as
well as in the international researches on this subject.
