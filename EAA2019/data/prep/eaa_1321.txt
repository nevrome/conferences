SWITZERLAND) AND ITS WOODEN SUBCONSTRUCTIONS
Author(s): Held, Julia - Streit, Sonja (Kantonsarchäologie Aargau)
Presentation Format: Oral
In addition to ”From Aquae to Baden: The Archeology of 2000 years of bathing history at Baden (Canton Aargau, Switzerland)” this
presentation focuses on the Roman remains from the thermae ”Aquae Helveticae”.
As a result of construction attendance since 1960 and the excavations between 2010-2012, several buildings from the Roman
thermal bath complex were documented: Three large bath-houses, containing basins, a large building with sequence of dry hot
rooms (laconicum), and a building serving as steam bath (sudatorium).
During the summer of 2018 a large-scale rescue excavation added new informations to the overall development of the Roman
thermae in Baden.
Due to the unstable subsoil, the Roman constructors had to find an adequate foundation to ensure a long durability of the buildings. To support the overlying structures, they made use of timber piles for the deep foundations builded massive wooden subconstructions.
Layers of clay protected these wooden foundations. As a result the state of preservation of the organic material is extraordinary.
Not only can the wooden subconstruction been study in its detailed compositions, but even the traces of the wood working tools
were still visible.
The first part of the presentation will give a short summary of the Roman bath complex and its development. In a second part,
there will be a more detailed insight into a wooden subconstruction with a rarely seen preservation.
