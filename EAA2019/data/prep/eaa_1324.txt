ITALIAN SPAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES

Presentation Format: Oral
At the end of the Middle Ages, healing waters in the Italian peninsula have been intensively exploited for therapeutic and recreative purposes. The use of springs has led to the development of thermal sites or districts and the formation of spas, inhabited
and occasionally fortified. It has also generated a real “termalismo” : a cultural phenomenon with singular social practices. The
intervention will detail the main features of the improvements made : the occurence of infrastructures (basins) and buildings
(inns, hospitals) ; it will underline the initiative of the public authorities - the rural and urban communes like the princes - in the
development of the sites and their control ; it will finally clarify the role of phicisians in the valorization of springs. Practitioners
have, indeed, largely contributed, in the peninsula, to elaborate a true discourse on the baths - perceptible through a singular
literature : de balneis treatises - and to forge the norms of the cure that have gradually spread to the whole of Europe.
