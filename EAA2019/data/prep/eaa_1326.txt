THINGNESS AND HISTORY

What is a thing? This question is surprisingly complicated. There are two broad answers. One focuses upon specific material
objects; this is common in archaeology, museum studies, and some forms of material culture analysis. In this sense, an object’s
biography is the continuous trajectory of a specific material object, including production, circulation and exchange, use, repair,
reuse and repurposing, and disposal; the category to which the object belongs can be taken for granted. The other tradition
focuses upon objects as constructed through frames of discourse and meaning, rather than actual materials. This is common in
history, anthropology, social theory, and studies of ‘intangible heritage’. Both answers are useful for specific problems, but neither is adequate. Instead, we need to look at thingness as a relational frame for capturing specific material components flowing
through time and binding them into an emergent entity. (This is a straightforward extension of DeLanda’s assemblage theory,
viewing thingness as a relationship which allows new capacities to emerge when components are recognised as belonging to
a particular kind of assemblage). This theory gives us the basis for defining the material processes characterising thingness.
These are often archaeologically recognisable. This argument is illustrated with examples from European prehistoric “art”, including examples which persist, examples which vanish and become mere material components, and examples which are redefined
and morph into other things through a long historical trajectory.
