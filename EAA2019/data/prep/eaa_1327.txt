APPROACHES

This paper addresses the specific category of skeuomorphs [i.e. artefacts formally mimicking archetypical objects by ostentatiously emphasizing their characteristic features, yet not serving their original function] from archaeological contexts being
linked to Bronze Age ritual activities, such as isolated depositions, sanctuary-like gathering places, and burials. However, the
deeper meaning of these objects remains elusive. Here, the skeuomorphs’ strategic involvement in ritual practice will be tackled,
including their deliberate production, use and discard.
Relevant theoretical approaches from ritual studies to cultural anthropology as well as object-oriented ontologies allow important insights into a variety of evident aspects, such as the skeuomorphs’ power as aesthetic media, their symbolic status, their
metaphorical potential, their exigence for performance, their asymmetric relationship with their archetypes, their processual
and transformative quality, and eventually their role in the formation of a ‘new truth’ (Harman 2018). With this referential framework in mind, the archaeological situation around skeuomorphs must be reconsidered: confronted with a revised, nuanced terminology, the peculiar artefacts can be contextualized within a web of prehistoric social circumstances.
