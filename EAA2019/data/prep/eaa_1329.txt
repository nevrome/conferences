This paper will present the preliminary findings of one of the first systematic microwear examination of Southern Scandinavian
polished stone axes. Just before the start of the Neolithic in the region polished stone tools appear. We know this period brought
considerable change; not just to subsistence, human occupation of landscape but also how they viewed their landscape and
their place within it. Polished axes are a well-preserved material manifestation for this changing world. As materials are not simply the structured residues of acts, but were integral to the changing traditions that we seek to investigate.
Research from the Netherlands suggests that their axes were never intended for used; instead, they were revered, and only
removed from their protective wrappings at important festivals (Wentink, 2008, Wentink and van Gijn, 2008). This study sought
to explore the possibility that Swedish axes were similarly treated. The outcome of this research was twofold. Firstly, I was able
to confirm the transformative process the Scandinavian axes went through during polishing and establish that it was possible to
identify where this ended and usewear began. Secondly, it was possible to identify a proportion of the axes studied that did not
contain felling wear, but instead had wear indicating a wrapping.
Finally, this paper will examine how implicit knowledge, habitual practice and material culture may be seen as forms of cultural
inheritance, which are not merely the outcomes of human action, but the media through which human projects are carried forward. This paper will provide opportunity to delve deeper into the shifting world of the early Neolithic and provides insight into the
alternating ideology, and material manifestation of changes in identity.
