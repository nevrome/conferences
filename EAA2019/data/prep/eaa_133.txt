used to bolster such feelings of resentment of the present by apparently providing a vision of a more flattering past. This is the
case e.g. for archaeogenetic narratives which can be spun to support claims of indigeneity and racial purity, heritage presentations which stress the most glorious periods of a nation (as defined by a subset of the population) or romantic notions of a lost
folk culture and unity in an as yet unthreatened Fortress Europe.
Archaeology has always been political and archaeologists are very well aware of these appropriations of their work. Yet, we have
been largely reactive rather than proactive. A minority of archaeologists have begun to be more directly involved in documenting
the crisis as it unfolds, joining activist groups and organisations, and writing archaeological narratives that provoke rather than
pander. Yet, as a field, there is a widespread feeling that we can do more.
In this session, we seek contributions which grapple with the interpenetration of populism and European archaeologyâ€”in the
field, in the classroom, in the museum, on social media or in the legislature. We see this session as an opportunity to develop a
proactive stance: How can we avoid the appropriation of our research and react when this happens? How do we choose what to
display? Can we use our research to advise policy makers? How can we turn the impact of the media to our advantage? And how
do we deal with sites that have a history of misuse or with periods and themes that lend themselves to it? What are the ethics of
doing archaeology in an environment of increasingly virulent populist politics?
