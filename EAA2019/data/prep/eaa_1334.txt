AGE METAL OBJECTS

Presentation Format: Oral
From the European Copper Age and Bronze Age metal objects are known which seem to be non-functional on the one hand, but
mimic objects which could be really used on the other hand. This may be achieved by excessively enlarging or miniaturising artefacts or by the casting of parts which are usually made from organic material â€“ e. g. the combined casting of axe and shaft. These
replicas were mainly found as deposited objects which underline their social and economic significance.
This paper will present some examples of these artefacts in particular and will contextualize them within the archaeological
record. This examination will be a starting point to approach the cultural phenomenon of creating replicas on a more general and
theoretical perspective as using replicas or miniatures in rituals or funerals is a widely known human social practice. A critical
discussion and reappraisal of this phenomenon in the archaeological debate is necessary as in contrast to other categories of
artefacts these metal objects have been assumed to be precious and supposed to contain symbolic meaning without exception.
Besides such an identification the social meaning of this practice was only cursorily addressed in the archaeological debate.
