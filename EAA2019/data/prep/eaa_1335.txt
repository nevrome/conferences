The overwhelming majority of finds of ceremonial swords and daggers (i.e. decorated with gold and put in the special context)
of the Iranian world are associated with aristocratic burial complexes, including “stray finds”, which, probably, originate from the
destroyed burials. Apparently, the closest practice of conspicuous consumption for the Iranian nomads became the funeral one,
for which the weapon turned into ceremonial. It is easy to see that the Iranian ceremonial weaponry, found in hoards is located
outside the nomadic world and possibly designates its borders for various periods. And the very tradition of ceremonial swords,
placed in a funeral context, pulsates throughout the history of Iranian-speaking nomads. The context of its appearance is the
fading practice of deposition of the swords and daggers in hoards, linked to the traditions of Late Bronze Age. Then the tradition
of “golden swords” is actively manifested in the Scythian time and after a while, it is revived in the Sarmatian period. In the Scythian epoch, the tradition of ceremonial swords is accompanied by chronological lacunae that run between the main links of the
periodization chain. Despite the fact that the maximum number of ordinary Scythian swords and daggers (in full accordance with
the Gauss’s Law) falls on the Middle Scythian period, the bulk of ceremonial forms refers to the finale of the classical Scythian
culture — the “Golden fall” of Scythia with its huge royal burial mounds and an abundance of gold, illustrating the thesis that such
conspicuous consumption coincides with periods of political instability and crises.
