REDUCED MODELS AND MINIATURES BRONZE WEAPONS: A VIEW FROM EASTERN ARABIA

Presentation Format: Oral
In recent years, the discovery of reduces models and miniatures bronze weapons has increased in Eastern Arabia. Dated from
the Iron Age (1300-300 BCE), these objects come mainly from artisanal contexts and/or associated with ritual practices. In a
culture where writing is almost unknown at this time, the social and functional significance of these objects and their contexts
remain very complex to address.
However, based on data from recent excavations, including Mudhmar in Oman, where many elements related to archery (bows,
arrows, quivers) were discovered, we will attempt to draw up an inventory of interpretive possibilities, and to place them in a
broader perspective that includes the entire Middle East over the long term, addressing the human/object relationship from the
point of view of ritual practices in relation to the initial (design and production) and final (deposition) stages of altered weapons,
and everything that can happen between these two moments.
