modities circulated. Copper was amongst the most requested goods. In this scenario, from the 15th century BC till the end of
the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus played an important economic role, as the island became the main copper exporter for the Eastern
Mediterranean region.
The export of Cypriot copper occurred mainly in form of oxhide ingots. They were rectangular slabs with projections at each corner, being on average 30 kg heavy and between 50 cm and 80 cm long. Oxhide ingots were so pivotal in Late Bronze Age Cyprus
to become part of Cypriot material culture. In fact, representations of oxhide ingots appeared in this period on different media,
like cylinder seals, bronze four-sided stands and statuettes. Similarly, due to their shape, miniature oxhide ingots seem to belong
to this phenomenon.
Fourteen miniature oxhide ingots come from Late Bronze Age Cypriot contexts. They differ from standard-size oxhide ingots, especially for dimensions and weight as they are between 2 cm and 11 cm long and they are between 4 g and 240 g heavy. Interpreted as votives, weights or recently as copper samples, miniature oxhide ingots from Cyprus have always attracted the attention
of the scholars. However, the past analyses did not explain or overlooked their reduced dimensions and other peculiar features.
After sixty years since the first contribution by H. G. Buchholz (1959), a revision of the material seems necessary. Therefore, the
paper aims at re-examining both archaeological contexts and previous interpretations of Cypriot miniature oxhide ingots to give
a fresh overview of the objects and their function.
