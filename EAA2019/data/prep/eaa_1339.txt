Nineteen recently discovered mounded cemeteries in the Spačva Basin provide a case study for the funerary landscape reinterpretation and its creative redefinition in the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition. While the new tumuli continued to outwardly
mimic the old, the process of their inner construction grew evermore complex through increasingly frequent, prolonged and
engaging celebratory events. The visually most striking feature of the new funerary practice was the selection and reassembling
of colourful natural materials, fragmented man-made objects and cremated remains in the course of the mound building process,
coupled with the enduring custom of raising large fires on top of the completed tumuli to signal their closing. Despite drawing on
a range of materials in the construction of the horizontal divisions within the mounds, when it comes to the spatial organisation
of the variously coloured layers, the people continued to copy the initial stratification which was to be found in the surrounding
natural landscape. With the stratigraphic layers, thus, taken up in space but retaining the mutual organisation of the original
context, it is likely that the differently coloured layers signified the upraised sub-strata and the fires implied the upraised funeral
pyres, thereby exposing the practitioners to structural elements which concerned the vertical rearrangement and creative reinterpretation of their environment. If, in this way, people’s organising instinct recreated the landscape anew inside each mound,
the planes of construction could have transmitted the idea of a unified design and allowed for the simultaneous interpretation
of the mounds and the surrounding landscape as extensions of each other, keeping current and meaningful the relationship
between the group and their environment in the times of change.
