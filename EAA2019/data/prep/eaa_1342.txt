Presentation Format: Oral
Around fifty Viking Age female graves with full size and miniature weapons have been identified across Scandinavia in the course
of the ongoing project entitled “Amazons of the North: Armed Females in Viking Archaeology and Old Norse Literature” (DAAD
P.R.I.M.E 2018-2019). Each of these graves displays unique characteristics as regards the treatment of the body, the deployment of objects and overall composition. While it may be tempting to interpret all women buried with military equipment as warriors or powerful female chieftains – an idea that has been previously proposed by several scholars – there exist alternative
ways of understanding the meaning of weapons in these very specific funerary contexts. By looking at the complete corpus
of all relevant graves from Scandinavia, this paper will seek to demonstrate intriguing patterns that begin to emerge from this
material, and by situating this evidence in the context of Old Norse textual sources and folklore, an attempt will be made to
nuance previous ideas about the connections between women and weapons in the Viking Age. This paper will seek to argue that
weapons in the Viking Age could have more applications than just in physical combat, and that in the minds of Norse women and
men they could be reinterpreted, transformed and effectively used for many different purposes.
