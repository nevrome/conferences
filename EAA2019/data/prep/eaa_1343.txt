Presentation Format: Poster
Through researching the prehistoric settlements from Neolithic and Eneolithic period on the archaeological sites in North Macedonia were excavated various findings – artifacts, majority of them are clay potteries, various terracotta objects of worship,
tools made of bones and stones.
Unusual objects are the terracotta ‘altar tables’ which are always surrounded by large number of animal bones, as leftovers from
their own food given as offering. Some samples are with concave surfaces and I recon they were filled with liquid for libation.
Interesting creations are clay models of a houses which are unique findings, especially in our region (Vardar and Pelagonia Valley). Rectangular form of the model of the house with the flat roof and sometimes with the gable roof, different shapes of holes
(as doors or windows) is confirming the actual ‘in situ’ remains which are discovered trough the excavations. The lower part is
representing the ‘original’ object, depicting the home and above it is a symbolic vision of the housekeeper –‘Women/Mother’.
The creator never forgets to present the ‘Ladies’ on the top of the houses with interesting hairdos, necklaces, earrings and
bracelets. Those object compositions (almost half of meter high) are often found near to the fireplaces and occasionally placed
on the pedestals.
The knowledge received from the stated findings, which are subject of this poster presentation, clarifies one segment of the
inhabitants’ lives from Neolithic and Eneolithic Period, in fifth and the fourth millennia BC. Chronologically, these findings belong
to the local cultural group Šuplevec- Bakarno Gumno and more widely to the Bubanj-Salkutça-Krivodol cultural group.
