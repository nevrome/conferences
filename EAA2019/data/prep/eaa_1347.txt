viduals (mostly children) are consistent with the consumption of a plant-based diet (teeth abrasion, anemia). This kind of diet is
also confirmed by multiple finds of tools used for processing plants processing (grinding stones). Buried individuals are currently
being dated by 14C dating. The ratio of stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) is being established in order to reconstruct paleodiet.
Present results of radiocarbon dating showed surprisingly old dates (6300–5600 calBC). Therefore it is necessary to obtain
more 14C data and do more analyses (for example aDNA) to establish the chronology and understand the economic and social
aspects of the past community. It is worth considering whether the old dating could not have been caused by a certain kind of
diet (such as reservoir effect caused by consuming fish). To verify this hypothesis the osteological material of domestic animals
was analyzed (C14 dating). The exceptional character of site Žádovice might be emphasized by the atypical position in the landscape, which might have influenced the subsistence strategy of the local inhabitants. Results of this study may contribute to
better understanding the way of life of the local community in the context of the LBK in Central Europe.
