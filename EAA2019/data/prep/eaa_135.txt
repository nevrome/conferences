SUPPORTING RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGIES?

Since the late 19th century, the culture historian tradition in European prehistoric archaeology has a legacy of being dependent upon concepts infested with ideas of ethnic essentialism, biologisation of identities and homogenization of social groups,
downplaying individual agency, social diversity and internal dynamics of communities. These were consciously developed within
nationalistic and fascist ideologies. After the catastrophies of the first half of the 20th century and especially, the complicity
of many archaeologists with the Nazis in Germany, most post-war archaeologists sought to get rid of these ideas, a struggle
that was – on a theoretical level – largely successful. Yet at the same time, the majority of European archaeologists held on to
the traditional toolkit, while downplaying or ignoring its ideological background and potential political effects. It seems that this
divide between theoretical sophistication, and everyday pragmatic reliance on old traditional models have come back to haunt
us in the context of modern aDNA research, which built a lot of its models on outdated culture historian concepts. This is not only
problematic because it takes away much of the aDNA´s potential, but it is also troubling because it opens the door to a political
misuse of archaeology and archaeogenetics by right-wing forces.
