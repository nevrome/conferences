destroy wealth.
This paper deals with a particular sub-project within this larger framework. Reassessing the substantial rings, ribs, and axe
hoards in Central Europe, we test the possibility that these are the earliest occurrences of commodity money in Europe, north of
the Alps. We use a novel methodology based in psychophysics to calculate perceived similarity based on weight and dimension.
In this manner, we take on board that prehistoric currencies and weights systems, in the absence of measuring equipment, were
approximations. We employ this methodology on a database of over 4000 rings and 1000 axes, the largest database to date on
these objects.
Test results show a clear perceptible equivalence between rings, ribs, and axes of the Early Bronze Age. Our findings report that
up to 55% of these objects are perceptibly identical. While the rings and ribs are almost exclusively found in the Danubian region,
axes circulated mostly in Middle Germany indicating that both regions produced local currencies. The occurrence of rings and
axes together in hoards in the contact zone between these regions strengthen the idea that they serve a similar purpose as proto-currency and were largely interchangeable. We conclude that rings and axes were regionally specific articulations of a larger
economic system of Early Bronze Age proto-currencies, based on shape and weight.
