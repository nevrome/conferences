PLANO-CONVEX INGOTS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE ECONOMY OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE

Presentation Format: Oral
Transforming raw metal into ingots created an easy way to transport the metal from the mining site and to establish standards in
their trade. During the Early/Middle Bronze Age transition, the standardised ingots with fixed denomination, like neck-rings and
rib ingots, were replaced with the heterogenous plano-convex ingot or casting cake (German: Gusskuchen) in Central Europe. In
the Late Bronze Age, the plano-convex ingot, together with the ox-hide ingot, is the most common bar type for copper and their
alloys in Europe and the Near East. It was formed in an open casting process by pouring molten metal into a shallow pit in the
ground or in a specific casting form. Most of the plano-convex ingots from Late Bronze Age hoards are fragmented. This is the
result of a targeted breaking in red-hot state, immediately after casting or after a later heating in a charcoal fire when they were
traded, processed, hoarded or sacrificed. Several fracture patterns of plano-convex ingots or their weight ratios in European
hoards suggest that these could embody a premonetary currency. How plano-convex ingots were possibly integrated into the
Bronze Age weight-money system is the subject of present investigations.
