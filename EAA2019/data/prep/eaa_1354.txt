Author(s): Kristiansen, Kristian (University of Gothenburg)
Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation use high resolution data from Thy in Denmark in the Early Bronze Age ca. 1500-1100 BC as a starting point for
reconstructing trade networks and economic systems. Recent work on providing Big Data on population densities has provided
new insight into volumes of trade in the Bronze Age. In tandem with isotopic data on the origin of metal and textiles it has revolutionised our understanding of the role long-distance commodity trade. How does this new insight correspond to previous models
of prestige goods exchange, can we reconcile the evidence from these different domains of research? It revitalises questions
about the organisation of trade, including mediums of exchange.
