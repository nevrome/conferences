This work tries to explain the economical system from Transylvania during Bronze Age, in the context of the European society
of that time. Considering the Carpathian Space as a living organism, I think that we can draw a viable model of a non-monetary
economy.
For this purpose, I took into account: the geographical position, the human and natural resources, the production of goods, the
internal and external contacts, the commerce. Transylvaniaâ€™s resources - huge then, relatively to the number of inhabitants -,
were, above all: gold, copper, tin and salt. The metals production and the salt were, probably, strictly controlled by the chiefs of
tribes or unions of tribes. Control was exercised in three ways: administrative, military and religious.
Inter-tribal connections were determined by economical factors, too. Some tribes were based on agriculture and cattle raising,
while others on mining, metallurgy and salt exploitation. Between them must have existed a permanent exchange system (proximity exchange). Besides that, Transcarpathian commercial exchange (commerce at average distance) and commerce at very
long distance took place. This especially because Transylvania was traversed by one of the commercial routes binding Aegean
Sea to North Europe.
Average and long-distance exchanges corresponded to large quantities of goods, therefore of a very high value. It is the reason
why the merchants were accompanied by armed men. The presence of weapons along the connecting paths is a proof in this
sense. Except military and merchants, caravans were joined by craftsmen (artisans) who were creating, probably, custom-made
artifacts, in bronze or gold. This is one of the models of spreading of some types of artifacts, and of reinforcing the European
bonds.
