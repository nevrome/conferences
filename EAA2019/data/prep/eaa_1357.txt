The late Shang period has long been a center of attention in the study of early Chinese civilization. The volume of archaeological
remains discovered from many regions shows a fully developed political setting of Bronze Age China, attested by the presence
of large cities, such as at Anyang, pronounced social stratification, high levels of craft specialization, a writing system, and constant warfare.
Cowrie shells were the first proto-money to be used in Chinese commerce. Archaeological evidence from the tombs has revealed
their wide use as early as the 16th century BC. These items, due to their small size and portability, proved more popular than
animal hides, jade, and silk, bartered. The shells used in trade eventually evolved into metal replicas. The evolution of copper
non-monetary means of payment in China can be seen in a three-fold way. Firstly, according to tradition, the idea of ‘money’
was invented by the state, ancient sages and philosophers. Secondly, according to the theory of exchange convenience, the
cowrie-money was chosen collaboratively as a solution to problems that occurred in a barter exchange. Thirdly, some scholars
believe that early money came into existence for the sake of preserving, measuring and exchanging wealth. If two tradesmen
from distant parts of China met during the Shang dynasty, they probably would not be able to communicate. However, they could
trade, using the same type of money.
It is still highly debatable where, when, and how ‘’the first China’’ emerged. But archaeological record from the Bronze Age shows
clearly that the use of unified means of payment considerably speeded up overall state formation processes.
