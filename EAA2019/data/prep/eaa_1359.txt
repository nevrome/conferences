Mycenaean and post-Mycenaean poetry. In contrary, less numerous contexts of the text dealing with cattle, skins and other lowrank commodities as means of counting and everyday exchange, have evidently no connection to the epic past, and must thus
be assumed as default units, or ‘fragments of the present’, characteristical of the time of Homer. The drawn picture is in general
agreement with an overall decline in wealth as reflected by archaological material from pre-Archaic Greece.
