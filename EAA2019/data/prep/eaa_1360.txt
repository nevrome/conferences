Lapis lazuli and gold as symbols of luxury and high status has played a significant role in the economy, royal ideology and religion
(e.g., burial practices, cults) of Sumerian and Akkadian kings since as early as the Early Dynastic Period, and later throughout the
whole of Mesopotamian history. Lapis lazuli and gold were also seen as very important and even key factors in the Sumero-Akkadian religion and state ideology because of their meaning. Solar and celestial (heavenly) aspects of gold and lapis lazuli were
strongly represented in Sumerian and Akkadian understandings of the world, divinity and kingship (also divine kingship). Silver
has been regarded as regular “currency” in everyday life among ancient Mesopotamians since very early times, but gold and lapis
lazuli possess another higher and much more sacred status; they were seen as elements of “royal treasury” or as the “treasury of
the gods”. Sources for this analysis are archaeological materials, artefacts from the royal cemetery of Ur (e.g., the tomb of Queen
Puabi – Ur I period), other archaeological sites of Sumer and Akkad, and various written cuneiform sources, e.g., royal inscriptions,
votive texts, various literary texts with mythological and religious content like the praise songs of Šulgi (Šulgi C, Šulgi D, Šulgi
E), etc. In this paper the research subject will be examined in inter- and transdisciplinary ways. I used the following analytical
methods: philological method, textual criticism, historical critical analysis. It should be noted that Ancient Near Eastern studies
is quite a complex discipline, encompassing historical and philological approaches and the analysis of cultural, religious, folkloric
and archaeological material. For analysis in this paper I mostly focused on textual evidence regarding lapis lazuli and gold in the
Sumerian and Akkadian languages, and also relevant archaeological materials found in Sumer and Akkad in the 3rd millennium BC.
