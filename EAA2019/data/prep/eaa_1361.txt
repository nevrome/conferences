The work of Tacitus (Germania) contains a broad range of information regarding social and economic relationships within the
‘barbarian’ communities beyond Roman limes. Confrontation with archaeological data allows us today to recognize commodities with an ascribed value that have been used in certain types of transactions. Firstly, it is a weapon and other iron items,
agricultural products and raw materials, but it is possible also to recognize other non-monetary equivalents of exchange used
by Iron Age communities. In Germanic funeral rites, Tacitus describes the inheritance and circulation of commodities (including,
for example, potlach). Some information given by him indicate the economic and social functions of gift and marriage exchange,
allowing us to understand the concept of possession and ownership at the time. Roman coinage and commerce appeared as a
factor changing and even destroying the economy of barbarian tribes. It can be certainly seen as a tool of economic pressure and
political expansion.
