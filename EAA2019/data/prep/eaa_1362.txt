Main social and economic developments of the Late Roman period provide the clue to the decline of the Roman Empire and to the
transition between the ancient world and the Middle Ages. This interregional transition, starting with the Migration period can be
best understood in terms of the replacement, of an ”ancient” by a ”medieval” style of society. The economics of the Late Rome
brought about consistent rise of incomes per capita for the general populace in the period. Another important element was that
incomes in the newer provinces, particularly Trans-Alpine Europe, and the barbarian areas beyond the limes probably increased
relatively more than those in the older center of the Empire. The first trend, a general rise in per capita incomes, undercuts a
majority of previous explanations of Rome’s fall. The second characteristic, changes in relative incomes among regions provide
a positive implication as to the expected adaptation of the Roman state.
In this study we focus on living conditions, agriculture and economy of non-Roman populations inhabiting Central Europe, especially Silesia, SW Poland during the Migration Period (phase D1, ca. 360/370-400/410 AD, to phase D3, CA. 450-490 AD).
The populations inhabiting Silesia in the IV-V century AD probably constituted a multi-ethnic conglomerate. The archaeological
record of this period is highly incomplete for many reasons. Newly discovered cemetery in Tyniec upon Ślęza offers a unique opportunity to study dietary practice, mobility, living conditions, economy and cultural hybridization among barbarian world outside
of Roman limes. The site seems to be associated with the so-called post-Chernyakhov horizon, i.e. the waves of refugees from
the Huns.
