The Viking Age was the last stage of North-European prehistory, and a three-century-long transitional period from the post-Roman Iron Age to the Middle Ages in Scandinavia and beyond. It started with the first Viking raids in Western Europe before AD 800,
and ended in many parts of the larger Viking world between AD 1050 and 1150. The main cultural innovations and most peculiar
features of social change of the period are urbanization, large-scale commodity production and exchange, long-distance trade,
silver economies, and a rapid growth in market relations and the scale of individual wealth. Accompanied by impressive development of maritime traffic, and territorial expansion (colonization) of the world beyond their homelands, the Viking-Age communities underwent a significant transition from gift-giving and redistribution economies, typical of the previous periods, towards
the many patterns of active economic behaviour including raiding, traiding, hoarding, accumulating wealth in the form of silver,
and producing commodities for local and international exchange. The paper also examines the chronologies of the processes in
question based on numismatic and written evidence.
