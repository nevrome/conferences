Presentation Format: Poster
The terracotta discs generally found from the Painted Grey Ware and Northern Black Polished Ware levels have not received the
attention they deserve. The excavations in western Uttar Pradesh have yielded terracotta discs in abundance. It covers the periods from 1500 BC to 600 BC. Discs are casually described as minor objects like amulets, beads, bangles, toys, tools and other
small objects of daily use. It is generally flat and circular in shape and made of well-fired clay. Discs are designed intentionally for
the particular use and are exclusively decorated by making incised designs on both the surfaces. The ridges are also executed on
the edges along the periphery of the disc. However, plain disc have also been found from the excavations. The theme of poster
is comparative study of its motifs, symbols with punch marked coins and other traditional use, if any, within a cultural period and
its transition from one culture to another. The punch marked coins consist of a rich repertoire of symbols. The symbols which are
found on terracotta disc are very much identical with the symbols on punch marked coins. Perhaps the thought of symbols on
punch marked coins must have been derived from terracotta disc. The theme of considering terracotta disc as the non- metallic
coin is the similarity of the symbols in both objects. The common symbols are: Human figurines, Sun, Moon, Mountain, Swastika,
Wheel, Star,Taurine,Tree,Arrow,Fish, Eye or Leaf design,Circle,Rectagle and other geometrical pattern etc. Apart from the astronomical signs some graffiti marks and unidentified symbols are also seen on terracotta disc.
