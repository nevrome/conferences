National portable antiquities schemes that record small archaeological finds made by members of the public have the potential
to offer a vast novel source of evidence on past human activity and to enable valuable comparisons between material cultures
in different regions and countries. Like all historical databases, however, the ones created by these schemes can themselves
be considered as artefacts the character of which is determined by the needs, circumstances and decisions of the people and
institutions who design and maintain them, and the individuals who contribute to their contents.
With particular reference to the medieval finds recorded by the pioneering Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) in England and
Wales, this paper proposes to examine some of the challenges that arise in using small finds data in the context of the biases
and features of a single database and consider how they might carry on into further cross-database work. What research or
policy-driven historical design decisions contribute to a databaseâ€™s current form? How do its various features enable particular
types of academic research, or other types of interaction with the data? How does the manner and the processes by which
finds are recovered and recorded influence its contents, the interpretation of individual finds records within their historical and
physical landscape context, in relation to other records within the database, and in relation to other historical and archaeological
datasets?
These points will be discussed using recent research on the medieval PAS finds data. A limited comparison of the overall content
breakdowns between some of the European portable antiquities databases will be made to illustrate dataset differences and
similarities. The aim is to consider perspectives that would be relevant to the range of established or emerging portable antiquities schemes in Europe.
