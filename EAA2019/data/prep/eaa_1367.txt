This paper will draw on the large archaeological and historical dataset gathered during the ‘Living Standards and Material Culture in English Rural Households, 1300-1600’ project to explore how unified patterns of consumption were in later medieval
England. This project combines information on the possessions of medieval felons (drawn from the records of the escheator
and coroner), artefacts recovered from archaeological excavations and those reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme. The
paper will focus on key object types, including tableware and furnishings, to explore the extent to which consumption patterns
and preferences vary regionally, through time and across society. By exploring the relationship between these variables a model
for medieval consumption will be put forwards, in order to explain how and why some elements of consumption appear unified,
whilst others vary. This multi-scalar approach, drawing on ‘big-data’ and contextual case studies should provide opportunities
to consider the ways in which material homogeneity in medieval Europe might vary in accordance with factors such as wealth,
status, agricultural regime and profession.
