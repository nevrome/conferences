BRISTOL AND COPENHAGEN: TWO URBAN PORT SOCIETIES, TWO TRADING REGIONS, ONE LATE
MEDIEVAL CULTURE?

Presentation Format: Oral
Thomas Hore was Sheriff of Bristol, and a local Bailiff. He was descended from MPs and merchants who were involved with the
international cloth trade from Bristol. In his will of 1466 he left to his family and friends: land, property, an oak and iron chest,
gold, silver and gilded tableware and a blood red coat trimmed with badger fur. In addition, his household material and tableware
was bequeathed to others within his family, friends and former staff. Such artefacts have been recovered from excavations of
Late Medieval commerce centres, with substantial collections found in Bristol and Copenhagen, cities that are part of my PhD
research.
Bristol and Copenhagen in the Late Medieval period were similar type cities. They were both probably founded in the 10th century, developing from small ports into merchant cities in the 1200s. By the 1400s they were important trading hubs in their regions:
Bristol in the Atlantic and Copenhagen in northern Europe.
In this talk I will examine the material culture of the societies living in Bristol and Copenhagen in the Late Medieval period. I will discuss how these cities obtained a similar material culture even though they were part of different trading networks. I will examine
how and why material culture changed and how consumption and globalisation may have affected the material culture of their
societies. Lastly, I will discuss how material culture had an effect on their surrounding environments and the cities themselves.
