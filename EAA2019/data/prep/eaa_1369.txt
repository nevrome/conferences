IT DEPENDS: THE USE OF HARNESS PENDANTS IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE
Author(s): Webley, Robert (University of York)
Presentation Format: Oral
The study of medieval harness pendants at the European level has benefited greatly from the work of Norbert Goßler and Stefan
Krabath, who collectively demonstrated their use across a large area of Europe, from England and France in the west to Poland,
the Czech Republic and Hungary in the East. Within this broad tendency for embellishing horse’s harnesses with such pendants,
which were visually striking, along with the soundscape of the bells that often accompanied them, these authors drew out certain particularities in the use of different forms in different parts of the continent.
This paper aims to build on the work of these two authors mainly in terms of chronology and social analysis. A diachronic approach
will be taken to assess an apparent change (based on the presenter’s doctoral work) from a commonality of forms at the start
of the medieval period, to an increasing separation within Europe over the 13th and 14th centuries; here the evidence of pendant suspension mounts can also be brought in. Object construction and context of loss can be examined to assess the social
significance of harness pendants both across space and through time, specifically whether their status decreased over the
period considered. Finally, brief consideration will be given to whether the distributions of harness pendants support Krabath’s
tentative proposal of the division of Europe into seven ‘large trading zones’ in the Middle Ages.
