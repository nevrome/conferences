analyses, linguistic studies and multi-analytical isotope investigations have provided yet another layer of information about the
mobility and identity of people from the past. However, the conclusions of these studies are often understood along very sharp
lines rather than through an organic manner which embraces the interface of culture, biology and language. Through examination
of current misconceptions surrounding the DIY DNA fad and the uses and abuses of cultural identity symbols in warfare, this
paper first illustrates the enormous power of ancient identity markers in the here and now and the confusion and misunderstandings that derive therefrom. It finishes by offering a series of different possibilities for archaeologists to attempt to engage with
current political debate and to maintain a degree of control over the initial presentation of their results to the public.
