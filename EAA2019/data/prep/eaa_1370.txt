In 1483 Nicolaus von Popplau, a German knight in the (secret) service of his majesty Emperor Frederic III Habsburg started a journey that lasted three years. He had visited Germany, Netherlands, France and Iberian Peninsula. From those travels remained his
reports, in which he describes other nations and their customs, pointing out everything that seems different to him, showing at
the same time his own feelings, complexes and aspirations. In his writings there is not much about differences in people outfits
until he visits territories of modern Spain and Portugal. Did it mean that in Western and Central Europe there were no differences
which could have been seen by a traveling knight?
There are many publications about history of medieval fashion describing regional differences on the basis of iconography and
written sources. Archaeology didn’t contribute much to this subject, mostly due to fact that not many archaeological finds can
be considered as ‘fashion’ in the way how this concept is usually used. However, dress accessories (buttons, belts, brooches
etc.). In this paper I will show differences and similarities in dress accessories in medieval western and central Europe (ca. 12001500) from the perspective of those items themselves but also I will focus on their distribution, production and social context.
