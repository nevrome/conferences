The variety of knives form the Late Medieval period is large. The ones with copper alloy plates on their handles which are decorated with engravings of plants, animals and humans form a category of their own. More and more knives from the Netherlands
of this category are recorded in the Portable Antiquities Scheme of the Netherlands (PAN: a web based system in which metal
detected finds are recorded to be made available both for the larger public and academics). These numbers required the establishment of a typology, which is not only based on the variety of engravings on knives found by the Dutch metal detectorists, but
also on knives known from other sources (city excavations, paintings, museum collections). This typology makes is possible to
create distribution patterns in the Netherlands, and to compare them with knives known from regions outside the current Dutch
borders. Are the knives with engravings typical for the Netherlands or not, and/or are the engravings themselves typical for the
Netherlands of the later Medieval period or not? Moreover, the iconography and symbolic references of the identified typological
groups of engravings will also be discussed, which should make it possible to attached meanings to the discovered distribution
patterns of regional and/or supra-regional scales.
