which spread throughout the Roman Empire between the V and VII centuries AD and was responsible for millions of deaths. This
session aims to stimulate debate on perceptions of health and disease and on related practices of healthcare provision within
European medieval society. It seeks to bring together people from various areas of archaeology and anthropology to explore
ways in which evidence from material culture and human remains (considered either within discrete disciplinary parameters or
within an integrated bioarchaeological framework), possibly in conjunction with contemporary documentary evidence, can clarify both the figure of the diseased individual and the community understanding of, and responses to, health and disease in the
past. The post-classic, mediaeval era is particularly apposite for examination, as this period saw the formation of various important schools of medicine which helped to shape medical philosophies and medical treatment in Europe. We call for papers (and in
particular case studies) on the bioarchaeology of care, with a focus on medieval times, but will consider case studies from other
chronological horizons. Theoretical presentations aimed at encouraging constructive and creative discussion among researchers working on questions of past disability and care are also welcome.
