In the past, illness, in all its diversity, occupied a major part of persons’ daily life. To deal with diseases, injuries, pain, deformities
and bad life conditions, caused by environmental and/or social status, placed significant demands on individuals, their families
and their communities. Moreover, it had a range of repercussions for religious beliefs and practice. Contemporary material culture and documents containing information on medicinal, surgical and spiritual treatments for pathologies reveal that in the past
(as in the present) the restoration and maintenance of health - or, more simply, ‘how the sick was cared for’ - was a priority for
the people of this time. This introductive talk opens a dedicated session which offers an archaeological focus on questions of
‘disability and care’ in Medieval times. It offers a brief overview of Medieval health and disease, culture and chronology as a basic
framework in which to locate the papers that follow. This session has the aim to explain the logic, to drive the order in which the
papers are presented, and to provide a focus group among researchers from several disciplines. The final goal is to discuss both
why we (the organisers) believe this session to be important, and the ways in which it might contribute to a better understanding
of everyday, hitherto undocumented, life in this period.
