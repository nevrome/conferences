IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND PRACTICE, AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS

Caring for those disabled by disease or injury is a behaviour observed across all times and cultures, and is a defining characteristic of humanity. Because the type of care provided in any given circumstance potentially embodies a wealth of information
about those giving care, those receiving care, and the wider community context in which care occurs, ‘health-related caregiving’
is now recognised as a rewarding focus for archaeology. The bioarchaeology of care offers a systematic approach for identifying
and interpreting experience of disability and care in the past, with the goal of gaining deeper understanding of the lives and
lifeways of those affected. Triggered by indicators in human remains suggesting survival despite functionally-limiting pathology,
the methodology comprises four stages of analysis: Stage 1 describes the subject, diagnosis and lifeways; Stage 2 assesses
clinical and functional disability impacts and determines likelihood of care; Stage 3 models the care likely provided; and Stage 4
examines the implications of this care for insights into the subject and their social environment.
Although most bioarchaeology of care studies undertaken to date involve subjects from prehistory, a few exceptions demonstrate that the methodology can be used successfully with individuals from later periods. However, applying the bioarchaeology
of care approach to historic cases - managing the challenges as well as the opportunities encountered in negotiating relationships between text-based and material culture evidence - raises both conceptual issues and practical concerns which are yet
to be explicitly considered. This presentation begins the process. After briefly outlining the bioarchaeology of care approach, it
discusses how bioarchaeology of care analysis, in combination (or conflict) with documentary evidence, might help enrich our
views of life in Medieval times, and what changes to current bioarchaeology of care research practices and procedures may be
necessary to achieve this aim.
