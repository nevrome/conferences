pecially true in relation to sources which go beyond individual cases of care (such as monastery records) and provide information
on wider traditions of caregiving or details of medical knowledge. Archaeological evidence that provides clues to healthcare
practices in medieval populations is therefore particularly valuable.
This presentation contains the results of analysis of material from the archeological rural complex Mikhali 3 near Suzdal, one of
the princedom centers of the medieval Rus. We have excavated the part of rural settlement and cemetery, both dating to the
14-15th centuries. Skeletal remains of 25 people were examined to reconstruct paleodemography and lifestyle of this society.
The high percentage of children (42%) and prevalence of females in adult burials (about 80%) are typical of medieval rural populations. High frequencies of stress markers, traces of chronic inflammation processes, and a low level of sexual dimorphism suggest the group faced significant health challenges; nevertheless, a significant proportion of the adults were older than 40yrs.
While the quantity of stress-related biomarkers suggests poverty and tough living conditions, this conclusion is contradicted
by material culture finds from the settlement. The collection of items recovered shows a considerable percent of high status
objects, including three 3 fragments of bronze mirrors (undoubtedly imported) and Orda silver coins. These finds come from a
comparatively large area, so are unlikely to belong to a restricted social elite.
What do these paradoxes - survival to relative old age under stressful conditions, and widespread distribution of status items suggest about local society? The bioarchaeological data are used to discuss this question. One possible interpretations is that
there was a tradition of supportive care practice among the peasantry.
