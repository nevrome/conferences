CO. DONEGAL, IRELAND

Presentation Format: Oral
Two individuals from the Gaelic medieval population of Ballyhanna, Co. Donegal, Ireland had flexion deformities evident in their
skeletal remains, resulting in obvious physical impairments and mobility issues. The Bioarchaeology of Care approach has been
adopted to assess the likely care and treatment which may have been provided. In the first case study, a healed central acetabular fracture-dislocation was identified in the left hip joint of an adult male. This was a major injury and clinical data indicates that,
even in modern populations, this type of injury is particularly difficult to treat. In the second case study, the flexion deformity
resulted in osseous ankyloses of the left knee joint in a middle-aged male, this was likely caused by either septic or tuberculous
arthritis. The discussion will focus on the immediate care that both of these individuals may have received, and the accommodations that may have been made later in life.
