upper limbs, vertebral column, thorax, as well as os acromiale, suggestive of a painful life with considerable impaired movement.
In modern clinical practice arthritis and traumatic incidents, like fractures, are considered major public health problems, carrying
with them substantial disability and reduced quality of life. Although such pathological conditions are commonly observed in
archaeological populations, few studies focus to their actual effects on the everyday life of past people. It is, thus, important
to include such conditions in the overall discussion of disability in the past as they can also serve as potential indicators of life
quality and social care in a society.
