Archaeological excavations carried out in the 1990s in the former rural parish of Rigny (Indre-et-Loire, France) uncovered 1738
graves. Among the individuals discovered, a female adult presents a series of cranial deformities characteristic of an extremely
rare pathology, til then unknown in the archaeological record: the Treacher-Collins syndrome. It induces facial dysmorphism and is
generally associated with hearing loss or even conductive deafness of the patient due to malformations of the hearing system.
The retrospective diagnosis of this individual was based on macroscopic analysis and computed tomography (CTscan). The use
of 3D imaging made it possible to explore the impact of the pathology on the individual’s hearing.
In addition to the functional implications, the negative impacts of facial dysmorphic disorders in the social sphere are well known
in today’s societies while they are poorly documented for the medieval period.
During this period, diet was an important social marker. The analysis of the individual affected by this syndrome’s diet, compared
