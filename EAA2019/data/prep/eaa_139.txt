In recent years, Vikings have experienced a resurgence in popularity. An ever-growing tourist industry, particularly cruise tourism,
has sought to capitalize on this popularity. There is, therefore, great political and economic interest in the Viking history and culture. But herein lies a conflict. On the one hand are the archaeological facts, which generally consist of either rich, often female,
graves or ordinary settlement/production sites representing everyday rural life. On the other hand, is the stereotype, which tourist seeking and tour providers thus interested in presenting, of a androcentric society steeped in violence and based on pillaging.
One of the main historical events of the period is the Battle of Hafrsfjord, in AD 872, which is said to have unified Norway into a
single kingdom. The battle is of great importance, but is also widely debated amongst archaeologists. Currently, there is discussion about establishing a large visitor center at the presumed site of the battle. The suggested content of this center reinforces
this androcentric stereotype, focusing on the roles of men, power, warriors and the plundering of the British Isles.
What is the effect of this? What is the role of current research in this context? How should we react and/or interact with these
ideas, or not? Further, what about our own role in this? What is the museum itself presenting in its exhibitions? Do we have to
adapt, to this opportunism of the Viking Period to influence what is popular? Alternatively, can we, through integration and active
participation, get people, politicians and investors to engage in a more comprehensive, research-based narrative? Or else, how
does these popular presentations affect our view of Norwegian national identity and our own historical selves?
