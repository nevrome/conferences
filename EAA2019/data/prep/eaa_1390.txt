This research explores physical impairment and disability in medieval society through the biomechanical analysis and contemporary contextualisation of skeletal trauma and musculoskeletal deformities. For this study, the human skeletal remains from the
rurban parish cemetery of All Saints by the Castle (n=79), an Augustinian friary (n=38) and the hospital of St. John the Evangelist
(n=209) located in Cambridge, UK, were selected for analysis. The trabecular and cortical bone architecture of individuals with
complete ante-mortem fractures or musculoskeletal deformities that affected the pelvis or long bones in the lower limb were
analyzed using micro-computed tomography (CT) to infer physical impairment. The data collected from these individuals was
then compared to individuals without these conditions. Analysis of the CT scans revealed bilateral asymmetry and alterations in
the trabecular bone in the weight-bearing skeletal elements on the side of the bone that presented with a fracture or deformity.
These differences were only observed in the trabecular architecture, and no differences were identified in the cortical bone. This
suggests that the analysis of trabecular bone bone may provide a more sophisticated assessment of the functional aspects of
physical impairment as trabecular bone appears to respond differently to altered loading conditions than cortical bone. When
incorporated with social theories and contextualised, these findings enhance our ability to reconstruct physical impairment and
lived experiences during the medieval period.
