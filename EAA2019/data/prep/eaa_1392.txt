within larger medieval society. The most common pathological conditions observed in the sample (n = 111) include dental disease, osteoarthritis, and non-specific evidence for stress (e.g., periosteal reactions). Together, the osteological evidence suggests that many of the individuals suffered significant health stressors, but the conditions were debilitating rather than deadly.
In addition to examining health, we use isotopic data from bone collagen and structural carbonate to explore dietary histories
among poorhouse residents. Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope analyses indicate that poorhouse residents subsisted
primarily on C3 plants and protein from terrestrial and freshwater sources. However, the results also suggest differential access
to protein, and a small subset of individuals may have incorporated socially inferior famine foods (e.g., millet) into their diet. Despite a shared lower-class status at the end of their lives, these data suggest that the backgrounds of poorhouse residents may
have been economically diverse. The bioarchaeological framework applied here allows us to comment on the lived experience of
Regensburg’s urban poor and the social response to poverty in this medieval city.
