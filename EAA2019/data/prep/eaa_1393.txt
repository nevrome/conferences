Chronic war conflicts are usually accompanied by development of medical treatment techniques. Napoleonic wars during the
18-19th cent. gave birth not just to the new way of organization the field hospitals and appearance of ambulances, but also let
to develop surgery. High energy wounds due to close artillery fire caused the damages sometimes absolutely incompatible with
life. In the cases of severe injury of limbs the most common performed operation was the amputation. This technique is very
profoundly described in medical literature, but few archaeological finds are known. The traces of operation could be found on the
human remains originated from the collective burials dated by 1813 in Kaliningrad (former Koenigsberg). Several individuals show
the signs of healing process after the operation. Also numerous amputations were found in sanitary collective burial discovered
in 2016 near the Borodino battlefield. The pit contained scattered remains of more than 90 French and Russian Armies soldiers.
12 samples of amputated lower limbs showed no traces of healing. Microscopic and trace evidence analysis allow us to reconstruct the procedure stages and compare it with written sources. The place where the burial was found is located near Kolotsky
Monastery. It is known that after Borodino battle in 1812 the hospital for wounded soldiers was organized there by Napoleon. A
team of surgeons headed by D.J. Larrey worked where trying to save soldiers lives.
