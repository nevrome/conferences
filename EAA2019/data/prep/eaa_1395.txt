Animal mobility is crucial for human substinence. From Paleolithic to present-day, animal movements have determined the nature and abundance of resources available to humans.In paleolithic and mesolithic times, ecology and physical/geographical
boundaries were likely major factors affecting animal movement and provisioning. However, animal routes, rhythms and changes
through time are barely known, and several observations suggest that humans may have influenced “natural” animal mobility.As
time went on and human demographic density increased, socio-political structures became a major factor for mobility, because
political boundaries and human decisions determined whether animals could cross a territory or not. This may or not have been
associated with the mobility of goods.
This session aims to bring together Paleolithic to post-medieval times animal mobility researchers who are focusing on novel
techniques. Methodological approaches include (but are not restricted to) isotopes, geometrics morphometrics, ancient DNA,
and histological analysis. Integrative contributions, for example where ecology, paleoclimate, paleoenvironmental forces, hunter-gather relationships and material culture mobility are combined with chemical/physical measurements, are encouraged.
