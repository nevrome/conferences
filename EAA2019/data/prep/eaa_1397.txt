Presentation Format: Oral
Intra-individual variation of the isotopic composition of dental tissues can be used as a valuable source of information. The sequence of tooth formation from initial mineralisation, crown completion, root development and emergence is similar across all
mammals, with 1st molars forming and erupting first and 3rd molars emerging last. This sequence can be used to construct a
life history for each animal. Changes in isotopic value might reflect residential mobility or change in diet. A question important
to archaeologists and palaeontologists is: are the isotopic composition of different teeth along the tooth-row of an individual
animal consistent, so that measurements of different teeth are directly comparable?
This study analysed isotopic variations within individual animals to answer this question. We analysed teeth along the tooth row
as well as variation within individual teeth. In the first phase, three to six teeth were sampled along the tooth row from each of
23 ungulate individuals and δ13C and δ18O measured on bulk enamel samples, averaging the period of crown formation. In the
second phase serial samples were taken from M2s and M3s in two individuals of a single species.
