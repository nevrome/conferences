The tooth-row results show that δ13C values of different teeth from the same animal varied by 0.5-6.0‰. δ18O values of different teeth from the same animal varied by 0.5-6.2‰ There were no consistent patterns along the tooth row for any species.
The serial sampling showed variation of 3.7-4.4‰ in δ13C and much higher variation in δ18O of between 5.2-6.7‰. We conclude
that the presence or absence of inter-tooth patterning in δ13C and δ18O depends in part on the life history of the animal being
studied. The isotope profiles obtained from serial sampling in animals with tightly constrained birth seasons will depend in part
on the seasonal availability of food and water.
