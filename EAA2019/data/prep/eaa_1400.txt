Variations in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in archaeological tooth enamel are regularly used to study past mobility. While removing enamel
samples by micro-drilling and analysing the chemically prepared strontium using TIMS is both reliable and accurate, laser ablation-multi collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) has been proposed, and used to a limited
degree and success, as an alternative method for the rapid in-situ analysis of strontium isotopes. However, some studies report
the presence of molecular interferences on all the Sr masses, with additional interference in bio-apatites of CaPO+ or ArPO+
on mass 87. This is particularly apparent in low strontium samples, such as enamel, and which cannot be chemically removed
during LA-MC-ICP-MS. Without adequate elimination of, and/or correction for these molecular interferences strontium isotope
ratios will be artificially high. Human and terrestrial animal tooth enamel typically have very low strontium concentrations (c.50300ppm), which are considerably below the concentration required to swamp the effect of this interference (c.1900ppm and
above). While tuning for low oxides and using a collision cell can limit the formation of certain molecular interferences, this rarely
removes them entirely and calibration to a set of preferably matrix-matched reference materials may still be required. Here we
present recent work using a calibration set of low [Sr] human tooth enamels previously characterised isotopically by TIMS and
investigate whether geogenic apatites can be used, to accurately correct for remaining interferences on mass 87.
