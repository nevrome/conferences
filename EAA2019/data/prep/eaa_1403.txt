Material culture shows extensive trade networks in both the Iron Age and Roman period in the Netherlands. Movement of people has been documented historically and has been suggested based on the archaeological evidence. Until recently, little was
known about the mobility of livestock in this region. The size increase in cattle in the Roman period has been partly attributed to
interbreeding with imported, larger animals, but there is no proof for this. Strontium isotope analysis of cattle teeth from a rural
settlement dating from the Middle Iron Age to the Middle Roman period and of cattle, sheep/goat and pig teeth from a Roman
vicus provide new insight into the extent of mobility of livestock as well as into the possible origins of animals. These new data
have been combined with zooarchaeological and archaeological data to achieve a more complete picture of animal husbandry
and trade in the Iron Age and Roman period.
