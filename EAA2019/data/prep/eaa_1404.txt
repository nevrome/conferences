Camelid herding served as an important economic and social practice in the Andes throughout its history. The desert coast
presents an interesting and important context for these pastoral activities. The Moche site of Huaca Colorada, dating to AD650
to AD850, is an integral node in the Jequetepeque Valley of northern coastal Peru with evidence of long-term ties to highland
Cajamarca communities. Recent isotopic studies undertaking radiogenic strontium (N=106) and lead (N=60) analyses attest to
the diverse origins of camelid herds that could have included both llamas (Lama sp.) and alpacas (Vicugna pacos). This paper will
discuss this large new dataset to contribute to the debate of camelid herds on the coast and the practice of local versus non-local animal husbandry and foddering strategies. We argue that camelids formed important offerings to large feasting events that
brought local and non-local people together to reinforce existing bonds and create new social, economic and political relationships.
