Historical records show seasonal transhumance was practiced in central Italy in order to feed flocks with fresh pastures in summer and provide shelter in winter. Herds were moved from coastal lowlands to mountain highlands in spring and returned to the
former in autumn. Archaeologists have proposed such movement for wild animals in the region during the Late Glacial and that
hunter-gatherers followed these animals as a fruitful hunting strategy.
We tested this hypothesis by determining sequential oxygen and strontium isotope ratios in third molars of archaeological equid
and cervid species to explore the animals’ seasonal ranging behaviour. M3’s in both animals mineralise gradually enough to record one or more winter-summer shifts, oxygen isotopes provide a proxy for climate and environmental conditions, and strontium
isotopes for the geological substrates covered during this period.
Here we present the d18O and 87Sr/86Sr results from teeth selected from three stadial and interstadial layers of the Upper
Palaeolithic archaeological sequence of Settecannelle (Lazio). Comparative modern samples were measured to investigate the
