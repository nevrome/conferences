bioavailable strontium background for this specific area. Intra-tooth sequences show strong 87Sr/86Sr attenuation compared
to the variability observed in the environment, but there are consistent variations observed to indicate seasonal movements
across the region. However, such movements seem opposite to what is hypothesised and to have changed little through time.
