Organisers: Lamesa, Anaïs (IFEA) - Yamaç, Ali (OBRUK, Cave Research Group)
Format: Regular session
Rock-cut architecture are known since prehistoric times. These kinds of buildings, carved out from solid rock, is widespread
throughout of ancient communities. On their walls, this particular architecture preserves stratified layers that relate of their
carving process and/or of their use. They are like vertical test-pits that archaeologists can study.
All over the world, people carved architecture into mountainsides or out of isolated boulders for religious, social or economic
purposes. These buildings can have the shape of chapels, churches, tombs as well as houses, channels, cisterns, granaries, etc.
Thus, these specific archaeological sources help scientists to understand how communities or individuals have interacted with
their landscape and have shaped it.
Studying them is necessary to explain the economic dynamics, the technological advances, the lifestyle of communities and the
symbolic beliefs. This session is interested in papers that raise theoretical and methodological issues, in order to discuss the
state of the art in the field of rock-cut architecture studies. It is open to students and scholars who use different methods for
the study and the conservation of this peculiar archaeological feature regardless of period or socio-cultural context.
