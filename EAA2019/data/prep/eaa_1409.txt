ISLAND, GREECE)

Presentation Format: Oral
On-going surface and sub-surface research on rock-cut structures and related mobile finds at Myrina Kastro, a hilly peninsula
that delimits the present main port of Myrina (Lemnos island), has revealed vestiges dating from various phases, at least since
the Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period, in several extended areas.
During these stages, human action has influenced the landscape, which, at the same time, has guided choices of natural forms
and spaces and induced modes of operation. Natural rocks and a variety of combined artificial rock-cut features, including rockart, appear to have both symbolic and utilitarian components, concerns and purposes. They reveal a complex rocky landscape,
entailing an elaborate artificial system of space occupation, including intercommunicating carved features.
