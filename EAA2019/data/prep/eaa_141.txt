are crucial. Therefore the abuse of word „fascism“ goes hand in hand with completely new words such as „slniečkár“ („sluníčkár“
in Czech language) – the person who sees the world as great place to live for everyone. Because in a populists world, only the
people seen as „normal“ or „ours“ are people which should share the same world with them. This is actually something, which
falls into the nature of what word „fascism“ should mean. For populists of today – concepts of love, welfare, hope and the most
importantly – the truth – are deconstructed, shredded to pieces. We are in war with populism, this schizo-fascism, we are losing
and we have to fight back. We as archaeologists cannot remain silent. We have to explain the complexity and colourfulness of
the past to the public, so they will understand. Remember, the people who adore the “narratives of eternity” are stealing the past
for themselves.
