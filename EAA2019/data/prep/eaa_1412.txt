Evidence for light architecture characteristic in particular of mobile societies is difficult to detect archaeologically. In this paper
we investigate such evidence in the form of narrow cylindrical holes recorded on vertical and inclined walls of granite boulders
in the Czech archaeological concession in the western part of Jebel Sabaloka at the Sixth Nile Cataract (Sudan). Based on the
actual evidence, thorough documentation and virtual experimental reconstruction, we interpret these holes as remains of wooden pole-built structures, some of which may have been dwellings. The structural design is indicative of mobile or semi-mobile
communities whose territories consisted of a network of stable points or camps. Our aim is to highlight what can be considered a
significant category of North African archaeological and architectural evidence which has, so far, received only limited attention.
In addition to researchers concerned with areas where remains of prehistoric or historical occupation are tied to rocky environments, it may be of interest to those concerned with secondary squatting occupation remains within monumental architecture
not only in Northeast Africa.
