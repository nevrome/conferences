Over the past twenty years, a number of active archaeological excavations have been carried out in the region of Eastern Rhodopes. The studies of Prof. Ovcharov (Perperikon and Tatul) and Assoc. Prof. Dimitrov (Perperikon, Tatul, like deputy Head of
excavations, Benkovski and Angel Voyvoda) led to the accumulation of a huge amount of new data on the development of the
so-called Rock culture in this region of Ancient Thrace.
This is one of the areas in today’s Bulgaria, which have the most developed archaeological complexes, cut entirely in the rocks.
Together with the neighboring Strandzha and Sakar Mountains, many megalithic monuments are found in the Eastern Rhodopes,
but besides them, we always see the full use of the rock as a building material and the foundation of all the facilities.
Chronology in the appearance, development and distribution of these strong traditions in rock processing is wide. It dates back
to the Bronze Age – in the 2nd millennium BC – and continues without interruption until the end of Antiquity (7th century AD).
Thus, for more than two millennia in the Eastern Rhodopes complexes have been built in the rocks – sanctuaries, rock niches
and crevices, altars, but also reservoirs, water-supply systems, fortress and fence walls, whole rock buildings. For example, at
archaeological sites Tatul and Angel Voyvoda have excavated some of the most interesting rock tombs in Bulgaria. On the largest
site Perperikon a whole rock city is built in Late Roman times – fortress walls of several zones, tanks, rock buildings and streets,
