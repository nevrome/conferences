Presentation Format: Oral
Fish breeding in artificial, rock-cut tanks was a method widespread applied especially from Roman times, regained popularity in
the Middle Ages. Archaeological vestiges of such installations, which are rare to still locate and difficult to identify, date mainly
from that periods. Even fewer are scholarly known across the Mediterranean countries such as in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Cyprus,
Turkey and Greece where Roman fish tanks from Crete were identified and published many years ago. However, no particular
academic advance was made since then in the investigation of rock-cut fisheries notwithstanding their importance as archaeological finds, economic product and perfect example of utilization of natural and environmental resources. In the present paper,
two previously and almost totally unknown rock-cut fisheries are introduced, one located around a Roman villa and the other on a
castle, in the province of Messinia, South Greece. Noteworthy is that, usually, fisheries are accompanied by other activities such
as quarries and salt-pans, which we will also briefly demonstrate.
