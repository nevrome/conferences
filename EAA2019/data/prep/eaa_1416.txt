VALLEY OF 1000 CAVES

Without a single architectural feature or archaeological finding regarding the period when it was excavated, it is very difficult to
date a rock dwelled structure because these structures have always been used throughout the history by being changed and
some of them are still being used even today. This problem, which is even applicable to only one structure, becomes much more
significant if you work in a valley, containing hundreds of engraved rock structures. Kayseri (Caesarea, Mazaca) was the capital
of ancient Cappadocia during the Roman and Byzantine era. Soft volcanic rocks, caused by a million-year volcanic activity which
continued up to historical periods in the region, are observed in all over Kayseri Province just as the other areas within Cappadocia as well as the numerous structures, excavated in those volcanic rocks. Within the scope of a five-year study, Kayseri Underground Structures Inventory Project, previously unpublished numerous underground cities, churches, dovecotes, even rock
dwelled villages were explored. As the most important part of this study; in Koramaz Valley, 16 km in length and incorporating six
different rock dwelled villages therein, 476 rock-cut structures were explored and surveyed up to now. Although most of them
are houses and barns, there are also 34 churches, 11 underground shelters and tens of dovecotes and/or columbariums. We
also observed that many structures, likely to be Roman rock-cut graves due to their architecture and kline-style designs, turned
into storages in time. Likewise, some structures, considered to be Roman columbariums, turned into dovecotes. Although the
only structures, periods of which were exactly determined, are the churches, dated between 7th and 11th centuries, some of
the rock-hewn settlements in Koramaz Valley may be excavated much earlier as a part of rock-hewn settlement tradition for
thousands of years.
