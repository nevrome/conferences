Presentation Format: Oral
Despite the extremely developed technology and richness of architectural forms in the Aztec culture, only few of pre-colonial
buildings have survived to this day in Central Mexico. The few palaces, pyramids and aqueducts that survived the Spanish rule
are the most popular destinations for tourists and researchers in the region. Still ongoing researches in Mexico City extend our
knowledge about Aztec architecture.
At the same time, rock-cut constructions are much less popular. The technology of forging buildings in the rock was not common
in the Aztec world. Only several rock-cut structures have survived to this day, especially in archaeological sites of Malinalco and
Tetzcotzinco. These remains of temples are one of the most enigmatic remnants of this pre-Hispanic culture.
The aim of the paper is to present the preliminary results of analyses on the monolithic Aztec temples. These studies include
both technical issues and an attempt to interpret these structures. The paper includes the results of modern documentation
(such as 3D scanning) of the architectural remnants, especially from Tetzcotzinco. The entire documentation was used to elaborate the construction issues of these temples. Also we were trying to track the changes in their form in recent centuries. In conclusion, I will present a broader analysis of the context and the sites of Malinalco and Tetzcotzinco, which will answer questions
about the function and use of monolithic temples and their significance in the Aztec worldview.
