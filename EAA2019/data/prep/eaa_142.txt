THE POSTNATIONAL CRITIQUE – A RESPONSE TO REACTIONARY POPULISM?

Archaeologists have long recognized the deep connection between archaeology and nationalism. The resurgence of reactionary
populism requires a renewed scrutiny of this relationship, aiming towards positive action for a more inclusive future. A postnational critique offers the potential to understand how the study of the past intersects with national narratives and articulates
new ways of acting against it. Postnationalism theory presents one way of addressing both the present political situation and
the need to rejuvenate archaeological theory to meet this danger—it provides both a warning of how nationalism continues to
influence research and an entreaty for archaeology to embrace its political nature. The postnational critique advanced here identifies and questions the use of material and textual evidence from the past in support of methodological nationalism, arguing
against the perpetuation of exclusive categories of identity and dualities such as ‘civilisation versus barbarism’. By exploring the
history of Roman archaeology in Romania and the public reception of Roman studies in Britain through the postnational critique,
this paper argues that while the past has always been and always will be political, archaeology as a discipline is at a watershed
moment—archaeologists must become unapologetic political actors.
