FRONTIER BETWEEN TWO CIVILIZATIONS

The town of Krupina located between the winemaking and mining regions of central Slovakia made a significant profit from wine
trade, especially after the 1526 battle of Mohacs. Soon after this the once inland town appeared directly on the border. Not
only a political border but on the cultural border of the Islamic and Christian world as well, with the Ottoman Empire becoming its
neighbor. This new situation together with favorable natural conditions and specific location of the town, made Krupina’s wine
trade crucial.
In order to protect the town’s profitable activities from the tumultuous events at the frontier, the town developed a specific system of extensive storage rooms in a relatively small area encircled with town walls, in the form of underground cellars carved in
rock. While some of this underground rock cut architecture remains inaccessible due blocked entrances, the others are partially
inaccessible due to their location on private properties. Monument Board of Slovak Republic has attempted to map and evaluate
the entire later category, which but for one instance was a success. The obtained data was then placed into the context of the
historical and contemporary political situation and with the results of non-destructive landscape survey in the bounds of the
town’s cadaster. This contribution examines the origin, mapping and assessment of this phenomenon at this site which is unique
in the area of Slovakia as well as the perspectives of its protection and use for the community.
