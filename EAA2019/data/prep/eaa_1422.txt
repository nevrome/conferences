yellow-grey wind-carried sedimentsand is highly subdued to erosion processes. Human use of the soil has a long tradition documented e.g. in Neolithic sites with “pocket-form” shelters dug in the loess. Digging or cutting dwellings in the loess continues in
several forms and regions along the valley of the Yellow River till the present.
Conventional interpretation models explain the act of digging-out the space by the function attributed to the (final?) resulting
form – living, working, or depositing – such ensembles being summarised as troglodytic architecture. Focusing on the presumed
purpose such approaches even use questionable expressions such as “constructed (or built) caves in natural holes”.The present
study refers to published evidence on spaces dug-out in loess in the valley of Yellow River through an approach of prehistoric
archaeology originally implemented on Neolithic pit-housings in Europe. The approach focuses on the acts of digging and shaping
the hole or pit as social actions themselves – not necessarily bound (solely) to the function of the pit. This approach enables
new modes of understanding e.g. the collective engagement of the community in the process of digging pits in the loess soil
or of constructing rammed-earth walls from loess as mise-en-matière of collective memory. The particular significance of the
digging act may extend beyondhistorically and regionally variable patterns of its relation to the explicit or implicit function of the
construction form. Layers of significance may be related to (earlier) expressions of social interactions and social linkage, thus
providing space for revealing symbolical relations between human actors and the various forms of cut soil.
