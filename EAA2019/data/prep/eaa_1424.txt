CART-RUTS IN WESTERN SICILY

The term cart-ruts defines road routes characterized by parallel grooves dug in the rocky bank, sometimes even tens of cm in
depth, which are believed to have been left over the centuries by vehicles, probably carriages or sleds. Itâ€™s certainly the first
traces of stable road system we have met along the coasts of the central Mediterranean (Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, Tunisia). The
presence of cart-ruts in Sicily has never been the subject of specific studies, unlike, for example, in neighboring Malta where
these road structures have been well studied and dated back, in some cases, to an epoch preceeding the Punic colonization.
Only recently, in Sicily, in the territory of Mazara, have been found cart-ruts cut from burial plots referable to the Archaic period,
assuming that the road had been traced before the 6th or 7th century BC. Cart-ruts are present in Sicily especially in the western
end and in the south-east of the island, where the morphology of the territory is characterized by the presence of large flat limestone terraces near the coast. On these terraces, countless quarries for the extraction of the building stone, connected to the
routes of the cart-ruts, were active over the centuries.
The study has mainly taken into consideration the western territory of Sicily and the Egadi islands, where there are hundreds of
parallel grooves dug into the rock, which have profoundly marked part of the coastal landscape. Unfortunately, these structures,
now completely forgotten by the local communities, risk disappearing under the pressure of building expansion and new roads.
As a consequence, this study wants to underline the important economic and cultural role of cart-ruts, with the intention/aim of
starting a path of knowledge and protection of this important heritage.
