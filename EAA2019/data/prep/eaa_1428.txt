This paper aims to engage with the rich tradition of crop selection in Egypt and its adjacent regions from the 1st millennium B.C.
until the early Islamic period, with a focus on the Roman period. It aims to assess the different crop chronologies that have been
forwarded over the past century and improve them with additional, interdisciplinary data. In Egypt historians (and papyrologists)
have long been interested in shifts in crops cultivated, yet the traditions of the historians and archaeobotanists have remained
largely separate. The paper furthermore aims to compare crop chronologies within and beyond Egypt. It will assess the differences in crop selection between the Nile valley, the Fayum depression and the Western Desert Oases on the regional level, but
also make the comparison with Libya and ‘Africa’ on the interregional level. A special focus will be on Nubia (Sudan), a region long
recognized as a corridor for the spread of crops and farming technologies as well as region just beyond the Roman frontier, which
allows us to obtain both insights into the diffusion of crops as well as the effects of being, or not being, part of the wider Hellenistic and Roman world on crop selection. Within this paper hydrology and technological innovation/diffusion will be key concepts
as well as the integration of areas into wider economic networks.
