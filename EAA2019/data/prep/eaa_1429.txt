Archaeobotany has a long history in the Near East, with many sites incorporating archaeobotanical sampling into their excavation strategy. However, much of this research has been focused on early prehistory and topics including the advent of agriculture, while crop choices in the Iron Age, Hellenistic and Roman periods have received far less scrutiny. Furthermore, while regions
such as north-western Europe, Britain, and, more recently, the Iberian Peninsula have been subject to synthetic studies that
highlight the large-scale shifts in plant production and consumption that occurred during the Roman period, these trends remain
