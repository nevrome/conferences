largely unexplored in the Near East.
In other provinces, the Roman period saw interesting shifts in crop plants, as well as the introduction of new plant species, which
may be linked to the increased economic integration and higher degrees of connectivity, as well as the expression of new identities. However, as the Near East had a long history of urbanism and infrastructure prior to the arrival of the Romans, the patterns
detectable in the archaeobotanical data may reflect interesting differences in the effects that incorporation into the Roman
empire did or did not have in the region.
In this paper, secondary data from the later Iron Age, Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Roman periods is collated and combined with
new primary data from two cities of the Decapolis in order to shed light on the broader changes that occurred in plant consumption as well as in the greater agricultural economies. Key findings include a general decrease in glume wheats over time, as well
as regional differences in the representation of fruits.
