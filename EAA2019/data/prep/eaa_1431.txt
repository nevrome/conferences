CROPS, CULTURE, AND CLIMATE IN ANCIENT ANATOLIA

Ancient Anatolia was a region of great cultural diversity and interaction, the place where east met west. It is also a large and climatically diversity area, encompassing coastal Mediterranean regions, semi-arid steppe grasslands and the Taurus Mountains.
The Iron Age saw the rise of the Phrygian and Lydian empires followed by the Persians, the Seleucids and eventually the Romans.
In addition to differing attitudes regarding urbanization and social hierarchies, each of these dominant groups had differing crop
husbandry beliefs and practices. However, despite the regionâ€™s vast cultural and climatic variation, archaeobotanical work has
focused almost exclusively on Neolithic and the Bronze Age sites. Yet there exist a small number of sites that were both occupied
almost continuously from the Bronze Age to Late Antiquity and have been subject to proper archaeobotanical sampling. These
sites, namely Sardis, Sagalassos and Gordion are each situated in differing climatic regions and have vastly different occupation
histories. The earlier absence of data, especially from the Roman period, has meant that previous analysis of crop husbandry
practices in Anatolia have remained patchy and incomplete. This paper will therefore present an updated regional synthesis of
crop cultivation from the Iron Age onwards, focusing on the interwoven yet at times conflicting roles of climate and culture.
