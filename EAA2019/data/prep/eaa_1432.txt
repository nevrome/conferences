Phanagoria is one of the largest antiquity sites on the territory of the Taman Peninsula (Black sea region, Krasnodarsky district,
Russia).The population of the antique city surrounded by the local groups. Agricultural patterns of economy in the region can be
considered as evidence of barbaric or antique traditions. Archaebotanical study of cultural layers of antique settlements and cities from VI BC till III AD determined the main cereals: the wheat and barley. Millet is often for the cultural layers of the Scythian and
Meotian settlements. Millet meals are typical for the Early Iron Age nomads of Eurasian steppes and for the indigenous groups of
the Caucasus. Consumption of a significant amount of millet (C4 type of the photosynthesis) can be evidence about the barbaric
traditions of nutrition and agriculture. The isotopic analysis (12/13 C, 14/15 N) was used to estimate cultural and time-related
dynamics of the Phanagoriaâ€™s inhabitants diets during three periods: Hellenistic (III-I BC), Roman (I-III AC) and Late Antique (IV-V
AC). The bone tissue of 75 samples of human and 11 animal bones and 2 samples of ancient barley and millet were success to do
mass-spectrometry analysis. The results show a high individual diversity of food preferences of ancient Phanagoria inhabitants.
Perhaps, this is the social and cultural differentiation of the population. The Roman and Late Antique groups are characterized
by higher values of delta carbon than samples from the burials of the Hellenistic time. Thus we have background to assume that
this dynamics is the result of the barbaric influence to agriculture and nutrition of the Phanagoria inhabitants of the late periods
(Roman and Late Antique).
