Significant changes are observed in the staple crops utilised during the first millennium BC and AD in South-Eastern Europe. The
aim of the current presentation is to trace these shifts from the beginning of the Iron Age to Late Antiquity in the territory of
modern Bulgaria and to explore the possible reasons for these changes at regional and sub-regional scales. The study is based
on the author’s own data and current publications dealing with archeobotanical remains as indicators for the diet of the ancient
population and the shifts in agricultural practices.
The second half of the 1st millennium BC is the transitional period when the hulled wheats were replaced by free threshing
wheats. During the 1st millennium BC millet was one of the main cereal crops. It continues to be used in the later periods but its
finds are more sporadic. Barley was also very common crop although during the different periods its importance changes. During
Late Antiquity rye started to be cultivated in the study territory, a crop which is more typical for the northern regions of Europe.
Apart from cereals several leguminous crops (lentil, bitter vetch, pea, grass pea) contributed to the diet of the ancient population
