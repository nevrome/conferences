during all of the study periods. Later, during the Roman period broad bean was added to the spectrum of leguminous crops, while
chick pea gained importance during the Byzantine period. From the beginning of the Iron Age onwards we see the increasing importance of fruits and oil plants comparing to the previous periods. The presence of imported species also increases, especially
during the Roman period.
The evidence considered will be also interpreted in terms of possible indications for changes in human impact on the landscape
through the considered period.
