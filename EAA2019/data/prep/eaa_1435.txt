Cereals are the best represented crops grown by the Iron Age populations in the western Catalan plain (Catalonia, Spain). Naked
wheats and hulled barley can be considered predominant even during the Roman period over the other cereals (emmer, millets or
oats). On the other hand, pulses are very rare both in Iron Age and Roman times, although lentil, pea, broad bean and grass pea are
found. The remains of grapevine start to be frequent in the 4th century BC.
As in other parts of Europe, the greatest contribution of the Roman world to agriculture in western Catalonia is the introduction
of new varieties of fruit trees. The early Roman period, 2nd – 1st c. BC provides us with new tree taxa: walnut, peach, and olive.
During the Imperial Roman period, apple/pear can be added.
In this paper, we intend to document the evolution of the cultivation conditions of naked wheat and hulled barley, during periods
of climatic variability documented by isotopic discrimination of ∂C13 in wood charcoal of Aleppo pine and evergreen oaks. These
show a period of low precipitation at the beginning of the Iron Age, with an increase towards the 5th c. BC that culminates with
high levels in the 1st c. AD. The isotopic analysis of ∂C13 and ∂N15 of a hundred samples of grain from nine sites, allow us to offer
an overview of the conditions of cultivation and soil fertility in relation to the climatic variability demonstrated by the charcoal
analysis.
