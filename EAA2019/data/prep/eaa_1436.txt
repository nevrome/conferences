The ERC program Rurland: “Rural Landscape in north-eastern Roman Gaul from the late La Tène Period to late Antiquity” (Advanced Grant 2013, N°338680, dir. M. Reddé, EPHE, Paris, 2014-2018) offered the opportunity to gather carpological data related to 655 archaeological settlements dated from the 2nd century BC to the end of Antiquity in the north-eastern quarter of Gaul.
This vast survey revealed local changes in agriculture that occurred between the end of the Iron Age and the rise of the Roman
Empire and allowed regional variations in crop production and land management to be related to changes in livestock farming.
The main categories of food plants, including fruit trees, will be examined to see how they interacted and fluctuated over time.
Complementary approaches, such as isotopic geochemistry (especially d15N) carried out on charred cereal grains and functional ecology applied to arable weed flora, enable a more detailed discussion of agricultural practices.
