ROMAN BRITAIN

At the north-western edge of the Roman world, the province of Britannia has been marginal to debates on the Roman agricultural
economy. However, a long history of archaeobotanical research, especially through developer-funded archaeology, has produced
a wealth of data with which to assess crop choice through time. Here, the results of the recent Rural Settlement of Roman Britain
project are reviewed, which collated archaeobotanical data from 2523 rural settlements.
An assessment of this dataset shows that whilst there are environmental trends affecting crop choice (more barley on calcareous soils) and some chronological patterns (increase in rye, oats, and free-threshing wheat through time), the overwhelming picture is of a reliance on spelt wheat and barley. This study provides strong evidence for specialisation in these two crops across
Britain, but overall the pursuits of similar strategies in crop choice between farmsteads and villas. However, insights into crop
husbandry choices in this study were limited by data quality.
To rectify this, a recent suite of crop stable isotope analysis (δ13C) and (δ15N) on sites in two key farming regions (the Nene
Valley and the Hampshire Downlands) has shown that δ15N values decrease from the Mid Iron Age through to the Late Roman
period, indicating an extensification in arable husbandry. This pattern indicates that surplus cereal production was achieved
through increasing the amount of land under cultivation, rather than increasing labour inputs per unit area. The similarity of growing conditions of barley and spelt wheat indicate a conservative approach to maximising agricultural production in this period.
