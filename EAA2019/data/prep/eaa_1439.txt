SYNTHESIS

Over the past years archaeobotanists have become increasingly interested in crop selection, as the concept may aid in modelling past agricultural decision making and elucidate diachronic changes in the rural economy. Therefore, they have endeavoured
to determine diachronic changes in the crops which were cultivated (‘crop shifts’) by constructing so-called ‘crop chronologies’
(i.e. qualitative time series of archaeobotanical data) and have tried to explain the trends that arose from their data. As a result
of these efforts, reviews of the archaeobotanical evidence from various regions and for various sets of crops are now available.
This paper aims to synthesize and integrate the regional trends in crops selection, solely for the crop category of the cereals,
from several regions into two meta-trends. It then sets out to explain these trends through linking them to macro-economic
trends and economic historical data: among others the trend towards a gradual increase of market integration in the Mediterranean basin, which culminated during the Roman Empire into what could be defined as the first ‘single market’, will be explored. The
temporal focus of the paper will be on the Hellenistic to Roman periods. Geographically the focus of the paper will be on trends
from three environmentally very different regions: Italy, Egypt and Britain. The trends in cereal crop selection in each of these
regions will furthermore be compared with commensurable regions: Italy will be compared with Iberia and Southern France, Illyria,
and the Alps; Egypt will be compared with Nubia and Libya up to Roman Africa; and lastly, Britain will be compared to the Netherlands. The paper will draw upon crop chronologies produced by the author supplemented by refined data from other published
reviews.
