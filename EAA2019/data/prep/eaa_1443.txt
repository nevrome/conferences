KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND TECHNICAL CHOICES IN PREHISTORICAL MINING COMMUNITIES: FROM
THE THEORETICAL LEVEL TO ITS EMPIRICAL CONSEQUENCES IN MINING ARCHAEOLOGY

Presentation Format: Oral
Mining as one of the first professional undertakings is much dependent on the exchange of experiences and knowledge. The
distribution of certain techniques such as the fire-setting, the black-powder-blasting technique or other smaller scaled technical solutions in mining, beneficiation and smelting processes is crucial to understand innovation and the change in production
modes and thus social and cultural developments. In the lecture theoretical aspects of a sociology of knowledge will be considered to develop a better understanding and will be combined with experimental approaches as a practical way to understand
steps of work and its embedded practical knowledge. I emanate from the basic differentiation of explicit and implicit knowledge
complexes in order to understand various forms of knowledges embedded in techniques and their possible transfer between
communities and individuals. This basic approach will then be confronted by case-studies by which the aspect of regionality and
interregionality will be considered as important to understand the forms of transfer being most likely. Connectivity as theoretical
model is a very important aspect in order understand under which circumstances choices have been transferred, but so is also
the adaptation within diverse geological, geographical and social contexts. The lecture will especially focus on case examples
from Metal Agesâ€™ mining between the 4th and the 1st mill. BCE. between Europe, the Mediterranean and West- and Central Asia.
