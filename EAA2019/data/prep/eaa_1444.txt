In many of the Middle to Late Bronze Age eastern Alpine copper mining districts, the smelting sites took on a surprising degree
of uniformity in their layout, pointing to a broadened standardization of the operational sequence. Many of the sites also exhibit
a surprising amount of longevity that can have periods of use spreading over several centuries. Thus the archaeological evidence points to transference of knowledge over generations within a single smelting district, while the generalized layout and
construction of the sites also implies a dissemination of the technology between different copper producing districts within the
eastern Alpine region.
