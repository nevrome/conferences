Such temporal and spatial transference of a copper production technology can also be observed in traditional smelting techniques practiced in the Himalayas during the 19th and 20th centuries AD. A small-scale copper smelting operation was first
described during the second half of the 19th century in the Mahanuddi Valley of Sikkim (present day India); the same operation,
right down to the shape and layout of the furnace, the type of bellows, as well as the chaîne opératoire was still being carried out
until very recently in the Okharbot village in western Nepal, roughly 540 km to the west. In over 150 years, no attempt was made
by the smelters to increase the volume of copper production by modernizing the smelting furnace or bellows; in-stead there was
an almost stoic adherence to traditional methods.
This paper will look at the role of movement of people and ideas in the dissemination of copper smelting technology, pulling on
the ethnographic accounts from Nepal and comparing them to the evidence from the Bronze Age Alpine smelting district, and
how the society in general – particularly social structure and in the case of Nepal, religion, to a large degree frame the uniformity
of practice.
