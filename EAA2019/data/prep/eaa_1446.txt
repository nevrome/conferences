Various studies on mining and smelting technology in the Alpine region during the Bronze and Iron Ages have uncovered surprisingly uniform finds and structures from several centuries and vast areas. The archaeological relics testify to a certain degree
of standardisation of the underlying technology, which gradually spread throughout the Central and Eastern Alps between the
Middle Bronze and Early Iron Ages.
This large-scale and long-term transfer of highly specialised techniques, however, was subject to not only a technological but
also a socio-economic dimension. In order to gain a better understanding of the economic and social dynamics behind Alpine
copper production, it is therefore necessary to consider both technological and socio-archaeological aspects with a view to
opening up the discourse that has so far exhibited a restricted focus on certain research areas.
It is precisely the dynamics of knowledge transfer and/or migration that need to be analysed at a higher level if processes are to
be visualised that usually remain concealed at the microlevel, which is so frequently pursued.
This is especially true for the Laugen Melaun phenomenon in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages, which showed a striking overlap,
both temporally and spatially, with the late copper production centres in the Central and Eastern Alpine region.
This paper aims to provide a preliminary examination of this question and formulates research perspectives for a more holistic
approach to the study of the dynamics that were at play in the prehistoric copper production in the Alpine region.
