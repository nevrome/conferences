During the Late Bronze Age a surprising degree of uniformity und standardisation can be observed within the Eastern Alpine
copper mining districts. While the Hallstatt salt mines are located in this zone of intense technological transfer, no evidence for
technological exchange between the simultaneously operating salt and copper mining communities can be observed.
This observation is all the more surprising as a close link between copper and salt mining communities seems clearly indicated.
A high demand in copper by the Hallstatt salt miners can be evidenced. We furthermore hypothesize that the copper mining
communities located in close proximity would have come in contact with the salt mining community through their need for salt.
But although a good case for intense exchange between salt and copper can be made, technological exchange does not seem
to have ocurred.
The lack in technological exchange, as well as the fundamentally different mining and transport technologies observed in Hallstatt indicate discrete tradition of mining and specific training. Moreover for the Early Iron Age it can be demonstrated that no
technological transfer ocurred between the different salt producing sites in the Alps and the salt production sites in Transsylvania.
