The Carpathian Bronze Age is one of the richest epochs in European prehistory. Large quantities of bronze, copper and gold were
deposited in numerous hoards and yet represent only a fraction of the material that was once in circulation. Despite rich deposits, mainly in the Romanian Carpathians, there is still no direct evidence of an independent primary production of metal. Rather,
analyses indicate that alpine copper was imported into the Carpathians at least into the Middle Bronze Age.
With the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, indirect evidence can be found in Transylvania that point to an independent primary
production of copper. Large quantities of raw copper must be regarded as products of this production. Alpine mining equipment,
which appears together with other features of alpine traditions, allows the conclusion that the mining companies that are now
tangible can be traced back to a technology transfer that was carried out by alpine specialists.
This paper presents preliminary results on the reasons and modalities for this technology transfer and on the impact it has had
on the appropriation of raw materials in the Romanian Carpathians. The results were obtained in the context of a new project
on ancient ore mining in Transylvania, which, since 2017, is a cooperation between Muzeul Naţional al Unirii Alba Iulia and the
Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum.
