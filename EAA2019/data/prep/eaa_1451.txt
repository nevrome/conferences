TRADITIONS OF PRODUCTION: THE ROLE OF NEOLITHIC STONE QUARRYING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
BRONZE AGE COPPER MINING, GREAT ORME, UK

A classic example of knowledge transfer between mining communities over time is the relationship between Neolithic stone
quarrying and Bronze Age ore extraction. This may have involved the practical transfer and adoption of tools, ways of working,
trade networks and ‘markets’ for the products and perhaps even personnel.
Such a model has been proposed for the connection between the Neolithic stone axe quarry of Graig Llwyd and the Great Orme
Bronze Age copper mine. These two major production centres are situated in close geographical proximity on the coast of north
Wales, UK.
In this paper, I re-examine the role that the Neolithic tradition of stone extraction and processing at nearby Graig Llwyd played
in the inception and development of copper mining on the Great Orme during the second millennium cal BC. I argue that the juxtaposition of the Bronze Age mine and the earlier Neolithic site is unlikely to have been a coincidence determined solely by raw
material availability and the co-location of a related technology. Rather, I explore the ways in which this continuum of knowledge
and activity concerned with the acquisition and use of available material resources created a conceptual context for copper
mining on the Great Orme, both rationalising and validating ore extraction there.
