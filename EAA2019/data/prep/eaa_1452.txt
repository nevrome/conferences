TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY OR A TRANSFER OF INTEREST? THE SPONTANEOUS SEARCH FOR METAL
ORES IN EARLY BRONZE AGE BRITAIN

Presentation Format: Oral
The evidence from the upland mineral-rich areas in the west of Britain where archaeological evidence has been found for Early
Bronze Age primitive copper mining suggests that what we are mostly looking at is the phenomenon of ad hoc. prospection by
local inhabitants carried out using utilitarian un-modified cobble stone tools and firesetting upon small vein showings of copper minerals, rather than systematic mining campaigns undertaken by specialists. There is some development of basic mining
technology to deal with problems of flooding for example, but this appears to be local, and not evidently transferred. Likewise
no evidence has been found for the local smelting of ores; copper ore perhaps being traded for metal with metallurgists passing
through these areas, the products of these mines thus ending up mixed and now difficult to recognize. Mining between 20001600BC may well have been a seasonal activity taking place in the summer months, and in many cases linked to the annual
transhumance cycle of pastoralists.
