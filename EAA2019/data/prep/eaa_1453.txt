The region of south-western Poland in the basin of the Kaczawa River belonged in the Bronze Age and early Iron Age to regions
strongly associated with the foundry activity. The presence of shallow copper deposits, located in the Kaczwskie Mountains and
in the Kaczawskie Foothills, could have an impact on the development of this area. The possibility of the functioning of metallurgical center in the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age, located in the immediate vicinity of copper deposits, seems particularly important. A distinct grouping of finds related to the bronze casting (casting moulds) in the vicinity of today’s Legnica could be
a proof for the separation of such a center. Casting moulds were found in Bronze Age urnfields, e.g. in Piekary, in Mierczyce or in
Legnica. In this area there are also casting workshops dating back to the Early Iron Age discovered on the settlements of the Lusatian culture in Grzybiany, Kunice and Myślibórz. The proximity of outcroppings of copper deposits in the Kaczawskie Mountains
and in the Kaczawskie Foothills region, especially in the context of a considerably completed state of research on this issue in
recent years, prompts us to look again at the possibility of local mining activities of copper deposits, which was often indicated
in the literature. During the paper, current research results related to local copper processing will be presented, including preliminary results of the first excavation research in the mining area.
