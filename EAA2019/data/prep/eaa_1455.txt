olithic to the Neolithic at different spatio-temporal scales.
We encourage archaeological and ethno-archaeological contributions dealing with modelling and quantitative approaches to
various aspects of Stone Age mobility. The session will explore the following questions:
•
what parameters can be used to describe different factors of movement?
•
what is the correlation between parameters describing environmental diversity, demography and the values describing
spatial movement?
•
can we unify the definitions for different spatio-temporal scales?
•
what factors can be indicated as those responsible for different dynamics of mobility?
•
when and why the outcomes of studies conducted at different spatio-temporal scales contradict each other in terms
of reconstruction of mobility?
Approaches to the not listed, but related issues are also highly welcome!
