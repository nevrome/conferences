Settlement strategies are an important aspect of describing hunter-gatherer behaviour from an archaeological perspective.
Important factors in analysing these strategies are site type/function and mobility. The determination of the site type/function
derives most often from a combination of ethnographic, environmental, and material culture-based studies. The general mobility
of hunter-gatherers is most often identified by the determination of lithic raw materials and their outcrops and, furthermore, on
the origin of other mineral materials, such as amber, molluscs and shells.
Nonetheless, it should be underlined that the ultimate basis of any settlement pattern analysis are sites and their characterisation on spatial, temporal, function and social grounds. Here I present a study of sites from Paris basin, northern Germany and
southern Scandinavia that bear the potential for a partial settlement system analysis, as they are only representatives of specified camps that are closely linked to reindeer hunting in autumn.
The study focusses on the spatio-temporal deciphering of the operational schemes related to the production of antler tools
and weapons as well as the identification of social group structures. It furthermore adds data from other fields (lithic typo- and
technology, zooarchaeology etc.) and results in the identification of a dynamic autumnal settlement strategy. This points to a
high flexibility and an equally high mobility of Late Upper Palaeolithic reindeer hunters in Northwestern Europe during the very
short season of the autumnal reindeer migrations.
