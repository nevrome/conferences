Reconstruction of late Palaeolithic human mobility is a complex issue. It depends not only on a given paradigm but also on dataset concerning human activity, chronology, and environmental contexts.
A goal of this presentation is to discuss the question of mobility during recolonization of an area located north of Sudetes and
Carpathians after Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) using a case study from Sowin complex sites (SW Poland). In connection with this
problem, using the same criterion we tried to answer the additional question whether there are differences between post LGM
sites from Poland in respect of settlement dynamics.
To resolve this question correspondence analysis was performed. The correspondence analysis is a multivariate statistical technique based on the graphical representation of cross tabulations.
Our study leads to some conclusions. Firstly, it would seem that the variability of Sowin sites in terms of typological and functional features show homogeneity. It is also interesting that during testing of the variability of sites we did not find a correlation
between mobility and cultural unit. This work has been financially supported by the National Centre of Science (no project UMO2014/13/B/HS3/04906).
