Poor preservation of organic remains at the Late Palaeolithic sites of the North European Plain makes the analysis of seasonal
mobility of those populations complicated. Moreover, ethnographic data suggests very different models of spatial behavior,
which are reflected in the related archaeological studies. Being in situation of rare evidence, i.e. representative collections of
fauna and remains of plants etc., we are in need of the properly parametrized proxies.
This paper deals with the model linking the seasonal mobility, duration of camps occupation, intensiveness of activities at different scales, subsistence strategies of the population groups and sites location. Correlation between these parameters is
measured through the correspondence analysis. Application of the model to Federmesser sites in the Eastern part of the North
European Plain enables the conclusion on the decrease in mobility and significant shift in subsistence strategies of the Late
Paleolithic populations in the area over time.
