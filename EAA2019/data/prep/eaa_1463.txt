This paper considers the role of perception in prehistoric migratory decisions. It is part of a series of papers that the authors are
writing on a general theory of migration and its application to prehistory.
Migratory decisions are examined from both the individual (agency) and aggregate level. Migratory decisions are considered
from the perspective of the migrant (individual) and the migrant group (population):, from the perspective of individuals and
the community from which emigration takes place; and from the perspective of the individual and the community to which the
immigrant moves.
Temporally, these perceptions may be different prior to; during; and after the migration events take place.
A simulation model has been developed and has been tested with a limited number of assumptions regarding the number of locations, migratory events, and interactions among the communities and the migrants. It has been tested using prehistoric data
from Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements dated 3600 to 3700 BC.
