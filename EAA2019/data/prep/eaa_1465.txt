NETHERLANDS

The Dutch Mesolithic is often characterized by dense spatial patterns of flint artefacts. These patterns can represent one or
more occupation events. Therefore large concentrations of flint artefacts are often interpreted as the results of serial occupations in a particular location. These locations are often situated in areas where different types of landscapes are in close
proximity of each other. These specific landscapes have typical ecological characteristics, such as dense forests, open water,
shrub lands, which could be exploited for different purposes. Sometimes it is even possible to determine in which season specific landscapes were used.
In the last decade theories of Mesolithic land use are often the basis for predictive modeling of site location and interpretive
frameworks for early prehistoric sites. Recent excavations on the levees on the Dutch Palaeo-IJssel river system have yielded
evidence for a relatively large Mesolithic dwelling structure, the first one in the Netherlands. We see evidence for substantial
effort that was put into the construction of the hut. This can give new insights in the formation of Mesolithic sites and the level
of mobility of these hunter-gatherers.
In this presentation we will discuss how we quantified Mesolithic land use, how we determined seasonal habitation and why new
evidence of early house-like structures can change our interpretation of mesolithic settlement systems.
