Format: Regular session
Technical advances in the last decades have provided bioarchaeologists with numerous new techniques for analysis of skeletal remains and other bioarchaeological material. This includes analysis of biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and hormones,
stable isotopes and trace elements, 3D-scanning, and other digital morphometrics approaches. While such techniques increase
the scope of archaeological information that can be obtained from bioarchaeological samples, they are not unproblematic and
have limitations. They can be misused for sensational research or to hype a technique without providing useful archaeological
knowledge. Methods such as DNA sequencing and 3D modelling generate large data sets, which creates problems in terms of
data storing, sharing, and standardization, but also provides new research avenues by allowing big data analysis.
In this session we welcome all kinds of papers on bioarchaeological analysis employing “new” technologies or a multidisciplinary
approach, regardless of geographic region or time period. As we do not necessarily believe that “new” equals “better”, however,
we also welcome papers employing “old-fashioned” approaches to bioarchaeology, especially when the author(s) can show why
the “old-fashioned” method still remains relevant, difficult to replace, or can be combined with “new” techniques. We particularly
welcome papers discussing the scopes and limits of new bioarchaeological methods in relation to fundamental archaeological
questions, and papers that aim to bridge the gap between archaeologists with and without a background in the natural sciences.
