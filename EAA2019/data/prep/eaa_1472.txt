For more than a century now, severed heads have largely been evinced by stone carvings and human remains in southern France,
but a new exceptional discovery (2003) allowed us to use recent and accurate methods from the excavation to the advanced
analysis of the human remains.
These bones form a corpus quite different from the remains generally associated to collective burials or special treatments
like embalming/comsuption (exclusively cranial, very fragmented, numerous, commingled and dispersed in several levels during
a century). In order to understand the events that led to the creation of this assemblage, a special recording tool, combining
“old-fashonied” methods, database and GIS was created to optimize the study. Not only for the spatial distribution analyse, but
also to facilitate the quantification and the statistic study of the traces and fractures.
