With the continued development of technology, doors are opening to the use of digital methods for archaeological analysis, especially in regards to human remains. Multi-View Stereo Structure from Motion (MVS-SfM) photogrammetry is a fast, cheap, and
relatively easy way to create 3D models using overlapping images produced from multiple angles around a stationary object and
is currently underexploited in osteological research and curation. For studies of skeletal trauma MVS-SfM can potentially provide
advantages in accuracy, precision, and repeatability over conventional physical measurements or those taken from 2D photographs. Whilst laser scanning and digital microscopy can also create 3D models, they are relatively expensive and time consuming. What is less clear, however, are the influences of the geometry of image capture, camera parameters, and photogrammetric
variables on the quality of measurements from MVS-SfM. Therefore, this paper presents initial results illustrating how best to
apply photogrammetry for the creation of detailed 3D models of sharp force trauma on human remains. The technique also has
the potential to create precise and accurate close-range models of other subject matter and therefore may present an invaluable resource for digitising, preserving, and studying more detailed aspects of preserved human remains. It ultimately offers a
straightforward tool to record, analyse, and present traumatic defects to a variety of audiences, as required in order to study,
share, and present such data.
