Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) describes the process of gaining knowledge from a data set including Data Mining
techniques (e. g. cluster analysis, feature ranking). KDD can be applied on multi-isotope data sets and reveals new information on
specific questions, such as habitat choice or import. The huge multi-isotope data set from Viking Haithabu and medieval Schleswig in northern Germany allows for the application of KDD. Due to the location close to the Baltic sea a complex ecosystem is
reflected by the isotopic signature, which cannot be discovered in total using common bivariate isotope analyses. However, i. e.
cluster analysis using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is able to reveal new information. Furthermore, KDD can help to select
certain isotopic systems containing more information than others for answering specific questions. This can be helpful if only
few material is available, which is often the case in archaeological contexts. However, when material is limited (i. e. archaeological
remains) it is obligatory to decide a priori which isotopic system(s) could be omitted from extraction without losing information.
Feature ranking techniques allow to choose the most informative isotopic systems, depending on the research question to be
answered
