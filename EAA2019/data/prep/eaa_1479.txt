Leprosy is an infectious disease that may lead to blindness, muscle paralysis and disfigurement, and, as a result, to stigmatisation. The disease was common in Europe during the medieval period, when numerous leprosy hospitals (leprosaria) were
established. Leprosaria were monastic institutions, and their purpose (isolation or nursing) has been a debatable subject for
historians. Seen from a present-day perspective, leprosy hospitals – having been established during a period when the notion
of contagion had not yet been comprehended – do provide an awareness of medieval attitudes towards diseases and social
relations. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the medieval perception of leprosy and leprosy sufferers by using diet in
leprosaria as a proxy. When dealing with the issue of stigma attached to a disease, it is important to reconstruct individual diets.
With the objective of improving our knowledge on how the disease affected institutionalised individuals, as well as medieval
society as a whole, we have conducted an isotopic investigation (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes) and explored the diet of
leprosy sufferers from medieval Danish leprosaria, by also taking into consideration relevant historical information. A further aim
is to investigate the organisational structure of these institutions by revealing, for example, distinctions between sex, age and
social groups, as well as dietary differentiations with local, contemporary communities.
