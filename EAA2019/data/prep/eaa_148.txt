NAVIGATING ETHICS AND METHODOLOGY: RESEARCHING THE STUDY OF CONTESTED DEAD SEA SCROLLS
Author(s): Rasmussen, Josephine (University of Agder)
Presentation Format: Oral
Since 2002 more than 75 new “Dead Sea Scrolls” fragments have surfaced on the antiquities market and subsequently been scientifically published. Over the last couple of years, however, a growing consensus that the majority of these are in fact forgeries
(cf. Davis 2017), created to meet demands in the relevant markets (Justnes 2017; Justnes and Rasmussen 2019), has emerged.
This raises pertinent questions about why the scholarly tradition and research practice in Dead Sea Scrolls studies has allowed
the inclusion of dubious (forged and illicitly obtained) manuscripts and objects into their datasets. This topic is approached in a
current collaborative research project involving ancient text scholars and archaeologists alike. Archaeology and heritage studies encompass critical perspectives on provenance and ownership that are both relevant and controversial in such a research
setting.
In this presentation, the methodological and ethical pitfalls and concerns associated with studying the study of Dead Sea
Scrolls, are addressed.
