sharp weapons. It was, thus, hypothesized that this mass grave was dug to deal with the death toll resulting from the incursion
by the troops of King Christian III that took place in December 1534, during the conflict known as the Count’s Feud. To determine
if this was indeed the case, human bone collagen has been AMS radiocarbon dating. Here we present the results of the carbon
and nitrogen isotope analyses on individuals from the mass grave and from ordinary inhumations at the churchyard, to start
evaluating whether the victims were local civilian rebels or foreign mercenaries. The skeletons from the mass grave have isotopic ratios that overlap with those of the ordinarily inhumated people, suggesting that the diets of all those buried around Saint
Peter’s church were based mainly on terrestrial foods and included significant amounts of animal protein, around a fifth of which
originating from fish (e.g. herring). This dietary mix is different from that of other Late Medieval north European populations and
compatible with Aalborg’s monopoly on the Limfjord herring fishery. Ongoing isotope analyses on bone collagen (hydrogen and
sulphur), along with planned oxygen and strontium isotope analyses on dental enamel, will likely solve the question.
