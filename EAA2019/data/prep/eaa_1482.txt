In northeastern Italy, the area between Ferrara and Ravenna was particularly important in Late Antiquity, with Ravenna serving
as capital of the Empires and Kingdoms that controlled the region between the fourth and eighth centuries AD. The study of a
series of fortuitous findings of skeletal material was done in an area in which migration and mobility was probably significant, but
poorly documented. The research is targeted on one hundred individuals from the area north of Ravenna, dating mostly to the
sixth and seventh centuries AD, towards the corridors that brought Barbarian populations into the Italian peninsula. Strontium
isotope analysis by multi-collector ICP mass spectrometry is used to determine both the approximate percentage of individuals
not born in the area, whether there is a pattern based on sex, and how many different geological areas are represented among
the non-locals. For the latter purpose, we use a database of existing analyses of animals and soils, as well as our analyses of local
water and plants for comparison.
The combination of strontium isotopes with oxygen isotopes for some individuals strengthens our ability to provide data revealing some patterns. The statistical sampling of small cemeteries across a broader area instead of sampling individuals at one site
is also valuable in providing a more robust perspective of mobility in the region during the early Medieval period. It is likely that
officials and soldiers based in Ravenna itself would affect the burial composition of urban cemeteries, while smaller and sparser
cemeteries, often overlooked, provide a view of the composition of the larger society and the impact of the sociopolitical situation in the region. The use of sparse sites also produces greater challenges when using strontium ad oxygen isotopes analyses,
since more variability within and among sites is to be expected.
