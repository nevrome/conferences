The current understanding of dietary composition in palaeodietary studies is mainly based on stable isotope analysis of bone
collagen (δ13C, δ15N) and bone carbonate (δ13C). In areas where plants adapted to warm and dry climates (C4 based-plants) are
present, their consumption and the consumption of animals feeding on them can be differentiated from the reliance on plants
adapted to temperate regions (C3 plant-based) using stable isotopes of bone carbonate. This application has proved immensely
useful in many areas of the world, for instance, for tracking the introduction of maize (C4) agriculture in the Americas but has so
far only been limited use in European Archaeology where plants are almost exclusively C3. However, historical documents and
an increase in the prevalence of dental caries in the 18th century suggest an increase in the intake of sugarcane (a C4 carbohydrate) in England. The increased intake of refined sugars has been linked to myriad health problems in industrialised England.
Sugar is a key element of cuisine but not always a dominant component of the diet, and thus may not be visible through the
isotopic analysis of bulk collagen or bone carbonate. Dental calculus, however, may offer a novel way of directly identifying sugar
consumption in past populations.
In this paper, we present bone, enamel and dental calculus mineral (δ13C) and collagen isotope (δ13C, δ15N) results from samples from modern humans from the University of Tennessee FAC of individuals who will have consumed a diet known to include
C4 foods and medieval English individuals who had no C4 in their diet. We present the different ranges of δ13C values for calculus and offsets with bone carbonate and molar enamel δ13C in these populations and reveal the validity of using dental calculus
carbonate as a new proxy for sugar consumption.
