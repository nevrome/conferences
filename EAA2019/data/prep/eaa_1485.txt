Ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis becomes widely used nowadays to get genetic information from the ancient avian bones discovered at archaeological sites. However, as for Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), though it was closely related to
human culture and society for a long time, detailed genetic history could not be inferred from aDNA analysis. In this study, we
thus carried out the first research on the ancient P. colchicus DNA recovered from 4th century avian bones found in South Korea.
We used femurs of two avian individuals (K-14 and K-15) for amplification, cloning and sequencing of P. colchicus aDNA. In NCBI/
BLAST search, the haplotypes of the current ancient pheasants (K-14 and K-15) were similar to modern P. colchicus DNAs (P. c.
pallasi, P. c. strauchi, P. c. elegans, P. c. torqualus, P. c. kengsuensis and P. c. karpowi etc.) that belong to the Eastern clade of Ringnecked Pheasant subspecies. The ancient pheasant DNAs (K-14 and K-15) obtained in the current study were the genetically
closest to P.c. pallasi, the subspecies commonly found in Manchuria and Korean peninsula. Through this analysis, we managed
to reveal fundamental genetic traits of the ancient Ring-necked Pheasants existed long ago in East Asia, thus providing fundamental phylogeographical information of P. colchicus DNA across time and space. This research was supported by Basic Science
Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2017R1D1A1B03030127). For any queries about this presentation, please contact DHS (cuteminjae@gmail.com).
