Recent developments in archaeogenetics and an ever-increasing dataset of ancient and modern genomes allow us to address
fine scale archaeological and historic research questions. For this study, we generated genome-wide data of 17 individuals excavated at Himera, Sicily, to determine their genetic ancestry.
In 480 BCE a major battle at the Greek colony of Himera ended in a decisive victory over the Carthaginian forces by a Greek alliance, ensuring that Greek city-states such as Syracuse retained control of much of Sicily. A second battle in 409 BCE ended in
