victory of the Carthaginian army and destruction of Himera.
Archaeological evidence of the battles comes from the western necropolis of Himera, where excavations uncovered several collective burials dated to the 5th century BCE. The exclusively male skeletons exhibited traces of battle trauma as well as weapons
embedded in the bodies and were attributed to fallen soldiers of the Greek alliance. We compare these “soldiers” to previously
analyzed ancient western Eurasian human genomes, including many from the Mediterranean region.
The individuals attributed to the Battle of 480 BCE show diverse ancestral backgrounds. When they are compared to previously
published western Eurasian genomes, most individuals are closely related to Late Bronze Age individuals from Greece, but others
show close affinities to populations of the European mainland. The ancient genetic samples currently available for comparison
are quite distant from Himera in time and space, making such comparisons preliminary with regard to historical interpretation.
In contrast, the individuals associated with the second battle show a more homogeneous genetic pattern, consistent with historical accounts that combatants in 409 BCE were local Himerans who fought unaided.
Integrating these genetic data with historical and archaeological evidence provides unique documentation of fighting forces in
the ancient Greek world.
