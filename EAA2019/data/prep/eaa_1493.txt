Childhood refers to both an extended developmental period unique to human life history, and a great variety of associated cultural constructions. The analysis of skeletal remains can provide important information about the diet of children in the past. Diet
during childhood reflects the availability of food and the social status of children and has consequences on childhood mortality
and the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life.
We explore the potential of quantitative dental microwear and mesowear analysis techniques to answer questions about childhood diet. We evaluate the influence of dental ontogeny and diet composition on the processes of tooth wear. Measurements
are made on the grinding wear facets of the second deciduous and first permanent molars. Facet shape and area (mesowear),
and buccal and occlusal dental microwear are compared between age groups at different stages of dental development in medi-
