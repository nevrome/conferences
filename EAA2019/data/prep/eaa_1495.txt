Technological knowledge and task-related activities of past populations are known mostly by analyses of material culture remains. In this study we use an alternative approach for reconstructing specific task-related activities by investigating paramasticatory use of human teeth. We have examined occlusal groves as accidental modifications of teeth on the dentitions of 34
individuals from the Danube Gorges, Serbia (c. 9600â€“5500 cal. BC). The lesions were examined both macro and microscopically.
Microscopical features of the lesions were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope surface imagining, which enabled a
comprehensive investigation of their etiology. Occlusal grooves were found on teeth of just three females in this population.
Our results reveal period-confided female participation in task-related activities involving soft materials (plant) processing (e.g.
basketry and/or cordage). Finally, my approach offered the opportunity to: 1) prove that soft (plants) materials were processed
in this population, 2) detect the individuals which were in possession of certain set of skills.
