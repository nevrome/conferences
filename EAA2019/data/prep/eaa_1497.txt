This study is focused on a case of osteoma, a benign-tumor reported in a skeletal series found at the “Adormirea Maicii Domnului”
Roman Catholic Cathedral from Iași (Romania). The series of 89 skeletons (children, adolescents, adults, mature and senile) is
originated from inhumation tombs and reburials, dating from the 15th-19th centuries.
Benign tumours of the bone can be dangerous as they may grow and compress healthy tissues. Osteomas are rare in the temporal bone and could be caused by trauma, chronic infection, hormonal dysfunctions etc.
The bone benign-tumor was identified in the skeleton of a male of 55-60 years old, in the mastoid area of the left temporal bone.
Radiological and computed tomography (CT) analyses show the case to be a homogeneous bone mass identified to be osteoma,
a bone-tumor type reported for archaeological samples. The left paramastoidian anomaly has an intense opacity, it is oval with
a net contour and homogeneous structure, with an interface to the adjacent bone of about 42 mm x 16 mm. In the skeleton with
osteoma, there are not identified other pathologies.
