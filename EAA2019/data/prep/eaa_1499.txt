Bronze Age Aegean human skeletal assemblages are commonly characterised by high degrees of commingling and fragmentation, due to the burial customs of the period and preservation biases.
These characteristics render the study of pathological changes in such assemblages an arduous task and its integration in the
archaeological narrative is severely restricted due to three fundamental challenges: (1) the ‘elimination of individuality’ caused
by commingling, (2) quantifying prevalence rates without excluding partial preserved skeletal elements, and (3) data presentation that can produce patterns interpretable at population level.
A pilot study on a sample from the Late Helladic cemetery of Kallithea-Rampantania, Achaea, Greece explored an alternative
methodology to analyse, record, and present data in order to address these issues.
Based on the recording of pathological changes as lesions present (instead of specific conditions) by skeletal element (instead
of being inferred on the basis of individuals) the study suggested that: a) observed lesions should not be ignored even if they
cannot be attributed to specific individuals; b) employing visual aids (visualised representation) and an alternative quantification
as ‘pathological’ fragments by total number of fragments (of each specific element) can be used if no other method is applicable;
c) following this approach, population-level patterns can be revealed, and -if associated with specific anatomical features- potentially allow differential diagnoses; d) differential diagnoses based on prevalence rate patterns, interpreted through the prism
of the general demography of the cemetery, can result in contextualised interpretations.
Occasionally, fragmentation was found to be beneficial to the study of pathological changes, especially regarding observations
that would have required destructive methods or expensive visualisation equipment, such as alterations to bone cross-sections
or within the medullary cavity of long bones.
We anticipate that this newly developed recording method will aid future palaeopathological research of commingled and fragmentary human remains from archaeological contexts.
