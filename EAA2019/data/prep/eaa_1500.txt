Presentation Format: Poster
Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of dentine and bone collagen is used to study an individualâ€™s diet, nutrition, and
mobility. Previous research has shown that high-resolution temporal sampling of dentine has shown the capability of providing
information about diet and mobility during the formation of the collagen; however, temporal sampling of bone collagen has been
limited.
This pilot study was conducted to determine if micro sampling of dentine and bone collagen could be used to increase the tempo-
