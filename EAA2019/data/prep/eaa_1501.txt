ral resolution of carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. The method was applied on modern samples. The teeth samples provided
by individuals who signed consent forms to approve the use of their tissue for research purposes and the project was approved
by the authorities at the University Hospital, Khartoum and the bone samples were faunal samples collected from a butchers
shop.
The collagen was sampled from demineralized bone and dentine collagen using a New Wave Micro Mill. The micro mill is used to
drill consecutive trenches in the dentine collagen following the growth pattern of the tooth. The data show carbon and nitrogen
isotope ratio values averaged at every 3-4 months of tooth formation. Using the micro mill, osteons were samples from the bone
collagen to provide a temporal resolution.
The results thus far indicate that both the dentine and bone collagen methods of sampling will increase the temporal resolution
provided by incremental sampling.
