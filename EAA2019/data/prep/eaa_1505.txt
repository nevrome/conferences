The previous two decades have witnessed a more widespread application of absolute scientific dating methods in Mediterranean prehistory. This surge in research has resulted in an ever-growing body of radiocarbon data in particular, enabling new
understanding of the chronology and tempo of archaeological change in Mediterranean prehistory. This paper will introduce the
session theme, before providing an overview of the state-of-the-art of absolute dating in the central-western Mediterranean
using a database of ca. 3500 radiocarbon dates. We demonstrate how patterns of growth and decline can be identified, quantified, and mapped out, thus developing models of cultural evolution and economic fluctuation, and providing a backdrop for other
archaeological and scientific narratives of population change and palaeodemographics. We also identify the geographic areas
and time periods that need further work, assessing the quality of the radiocarbon data for the region through a quantification of
what materials have been dated, and place the data within a wider European and North African comparative framework.
