FIFTY YEARS, PLUS OR MINUS: THE IMPACT OF RADIOCARBON DATING ON ITALIAN PREHISTORY SINCE
THE BEGINNING
Author(s): Whitehouse, Ruth (UCL Institute of Archaeology)
Presentation Format: Oral
Although the remit of this conference session is the last 25 years, radiocarbon was first developed half a century ago; dates
relating to the central Mediterranean trickled out over the subsequent decades and slowly started to have an impact on the understanding of Italian prehistory. In this overview, I pick out a few themes for discussion. One is the abandonment of the general
diffusionist interpretation of European prehistory, with absolute chronology derived from historical dates from the east Mediterranean, via a series of links that proved in many cases to be illusory. A second theme is the stretching of the duration of cultures and phases, which has implications for the understanding of the pace of processes of social change. Another theme is the
tendency of radiocarbon dates to form dating clusters, with the result that some chronological phases have many dates, while
others are much more poorly represented; this raises questions about how we define the archaeological record and whether we
are better at recognising long stable stages than those characterised by rapid change. Finally I discuss the specific issue of the
date of the Final Bronze Age/Iron Age transition as an example of a clash between absolute dates derived from different systems
(central European dendrochronological dates on the one hand and traditional dates for the foundation of Greek ‘colonies’ on the
other) and the potential of radiocarbon to resolve the issue.
