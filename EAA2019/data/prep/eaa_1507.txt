FOUR INTERESTING CHRONOLOGICAL PROBLEMS FOR CENTRAL AND WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN
PREHISTORY

Presentation Format: Oral
In this paper I discuss some problems and their solutions that appear as recurring themes inwork that attempts to build chronologies of Mediterranean prehistory. Firstly, I review the limited baseline of local marine carbon reservoir data that must be included
in calibrations of radiocarbon dates from marine samples and mixed-reservoir samples (including Mesolithic hunter-fisher-gatherer human remains), and discuss how modelling and carefully targeted work can improve matters. Secondly, I discuss the typically poor chronological controls for palaeoenvironmental sequences in the region, and why assuming synchronicity in environmental and cultural change is dangerous. Thirdly, spatio-temporal ‘edge effects’ during episodes of population change are
complex phenomena, especially for interactions between groups with different demographic properties. I consider the evidence
for such edge effects embedded in radiocarbon databases from the Neolithic transition. Fourthly, I ask ‘is evidence of absence
really evidence of absence in the case of gaps and hiatuses in the radiocarbon time series?’ This is particularly important in the
case of Mediterranean islands, where the presence of empty phases may imply that there were lower limits to viable populations
in isolated settings. The theme linking all these topics is how data-driven approaches to chronology can vastly improve our understanding of the past and the dynamics of human settlement over this pivotal region in world prehistory.
