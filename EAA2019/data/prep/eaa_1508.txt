Presentation Format: Oral
It has become clear that the earliest Neolithic in western Liguria (northwest Italy) and Provence dates to the first half, perhaps
the first quarter of the sixth millennium (Bayesian modelling in Pearce 2013; Binder et al 2017) and is earlier than that of central
Italy, Sardinia and Corsica. It also only seems to be less than 200 years later than the earliest Neolithic of southern Italy.
This rapid expansion northwards raises the question of the mechanisms of spread, and in particular of the impact of Neolithic
navigators in the intermediate areas. For example, barley pollen was found a deep core at Sestri Levante in peat levels dated
AMS LTL 1007A: 7213±65 BP, 6222-5990 cal BC, which may document Neolithic pioneers at a convenient landing place in an
intermediate area, though the presence of pollen suggests some permanence to occupation of the area, settlement that is so
far unattested otherwise.
In this paper we will explore the nature of the data (for example, western Liguria has the best dated Neolithic sites in Italy, arguably
the western Mediterranean), review current interpretations of the chronological data and suggest priorities for dating studies.
