FROM THE DUMP TO THE GRAVE– SEARCHING FOR HISTORIES OF ARCHAEOLOGY OUTSIDE THE ARCHIVE

History of archaeology is a vital part of archaeological self-representation. Through the creation of histories of archaeology,
we legitimize current praxis, create ancestors, role models and warning examples, and critique and debate past practices. We
remember and forget through the stories we tell. In short: histories of archaeology are our intra-disciplinary heritage.
History of archaeology has for years been associated with the study of archives. The archive is a situated blessing and curse,
since its content and organization dictate the knowledge production.
In this paper, I want to explore how past archaeological practices and professionals materialize outside of the archive though
sharing my own attempts at locating ‘alternative materialities’ of archaeological history. I will use my PhD thesis, Kalaureia 1894:
a Cultural History of the First Swedish Excavation in Greece (2016), as a case study. I documented dump piles and trench ditches
as monuments of practice, I made stylistic analyses of 19th century grave stones, and I studied threshing floors and possible
turn-of-the-century tent pegs in search of a more complicated history than that preserved in the official archives. My combination of a micro-historical methodology with an archaeological eye for materiality had varying results, some made it into the book,
others are left on the dump.
Arguing that the archive is the material manifestation of power-relations in the past, thus influencing the stories we tell, I want to
urge critical histories of archaeology to widen the search for alternative materiality.
