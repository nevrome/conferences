CONTEXTUAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

Rock-cut tombs are a key feature of the later prehistory of the central Mediterranean, although cross-regional syntheses of this
important funerary tradition are few. Distributed across the central-southern Italian peninsula, Sicily, Sardinia and Malta, rockcut tombs are widely known from Neolithic and Copper Age contexts. Previous overviews have mostly relied on tomb typology
to explore the emergence and proliferation of the rock-cut tomb tradition, with few studies having actively considered their
chronology. This has been in part due to a lack of detailed excavation reports and absolute dating, however, intensive research
and new dating programmes over the past 25 years have transformed our understanding of the development and use of these
important funerary monuments. This paper seeks to provide an updated overview of the development and proliferation of rockcut tombs in the central Mediterranean area during the Neolithic and Copper Age through a combined approach that considers
the available published radiocarbon data, tomb typology and contextual evidence. In doing so, this paper places the development
of central Mediterranean rock-cut tombs within a securer chronological framework and highlights the geographical areas and
time periods where further research is needed.
