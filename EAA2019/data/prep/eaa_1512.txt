excavated in the last century, allow a more accurate chronological framework, from the beginning of the Copper Age to the Early
Bronze Age.
Recent fieldwork carried out in the necropolis of contrada Scintilia, allowed to identify two main phases: the Early Copper Age,
with rock cut tombs, and the Early Bronze Age, with little chamber tombs. In the Rock-cut graves, containing multiple burials, it
was possible to isolate the grave goods and to assign them to the individual burials. For each of these high precision dates that
were obtained, which are therefore very important for the dating of the associated ceramics, attributable to the San Cono-Piano
Notaro style, of the beginning of Copper Age, now precisely dated between the late fifth and early fourth millennium BC, in agreement with new some dates of peninsular contexts.
New dates for the Copper Age came from stratigraphical series of Vangu del Lupo cave, near Montallegro (Agrigento), with painted pottery of the Serraferlicchio style, once considered datable to the Middle Copper Age, but with a very long development in
this cave, from Early to Late Copper Age. Radiocarbon dates for Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age contexts, consisting of
both tombs and caves, allowed us to specify the date of painted and not painted ceramics.
This paper will present a revised chronology for the Copper and Bronze Age of the Agrigento chronology, proposing that the traditional “cultures” of San Cono Piano Notaro, Serraferlicchio, Malpasso, S. Ippolito, Castelluccio, thanks to radiometric dating, do
not represent a rigid chronological sequence, as they were defined in the past, only on the basis of ceramic typology.
