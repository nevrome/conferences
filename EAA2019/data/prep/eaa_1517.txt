By reconstructing the practical and ritual acts of a funeral, a better understanding of how the living interacted with and treated
the dead can be realised. Through the analysis of cremated bones from Roman Britain, this research attempts to develop an
understanding of the funerary ritual of the time. Cremated human bone is an abundant resource in the archaeological record, and
with the proper analysis, it can contribute to the understanding of all stages of the funeral process.
The project identifies differential burning on the skeleton through a novel analysis of fragment size and shape using a method
borrowed from potsherd analysis. Utilising the software ImageJ and a script adapted for cremated bone, the shape and size
of burned bone fragments are measured from photographs. These data are recorded with information about the fragment and
skeleton. Then, all measurements (area, circularity, maximum length, and solidity) of fragments are analysed by group (bone,
