bone type, skeletal regions, side, burial, site, and site type) to identify patterns or variations that may have been caused by funerary ritual or practice. This research also takes into account other possible causes of fragmentation and fracturing, particularly
taphonomic agents, when assessing these attributes.
A pilot study analysing over 2000 fragments has been conducted and trends are emerging, one perhaps suggesting arm position
of the deceased on the pyre. This presentation will discuss the results of the pilot study and further describe the plan for the
continuing interpretation of the funeral through analysis of cremated human bone, including the use of experimental cremation,
which is contributing to the authorâ€™s PhD thesis. While this project attempts to expand understanding of funerary customs in
the context of Roman Britain, this thorough analysis will also contribute to a baseline understanding of the expected fracture
patterns observed on cremated bone fragments.
