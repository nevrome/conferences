At present, the major challenge to the analysis of cremated human remains is still due to thermally-induced alterations of the
bone’s macro- and microstructure. In order to improve common ageing methods for cremated human remains, a catalogue of
micromorphological criteria, which were observed at different temperatures during experimental cremation, was developed. For
this purpose, known-age archaeological and forensic compact bone samples from femur and tibia were used. Different histomorphometrical parameters were analyzed at different cremation temperatures, ranging from 100 to 1000°C, in comparison with
corresponding pieces of unburned reference samples.
For most of the parameters that were taken into consideration, no temperature-induced changes could be observed, which is
a major advantage for the histological age at death-determination of cremations. However, for some important metabolism-related histomorphometrical parameters such as the activation frequency, changes at different heating temperatures could be
observed, which do have an impact on the results of histological age determination.
Through these insights, further analyses can be performed concerning the development of histological age determination formulas for cremated human remains.
