One of the obvious problems in analyzing cremated remains is the encountered fragmentation of bones. The level of fragmentation tends to significantly differ between archaeological sites or even between features within one site indicating that some
other factor than deceased biological profile or post inhumation damage is responsible. In Polish archaeology, one of the commonly used explanation is hypothetical custom of putting out the fire with water. The author has researched the theory by experimental cremation of pig (Sus scrofa d.) extremities and recorded differences between pyres that were quenched with water at
