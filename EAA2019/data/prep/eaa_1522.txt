different times and pyres where fire was allowed to slowly die out. The fragmentation has been measured according to method
proposed by McKinley (1994). The small scale of the experiment did not allow for statistical analysis though there was a considerable difference in fragmentation between the quenched pyres and the naturally extinguished pyre. Following the hypothesis,
the quenched pyres had a higher amount of small and medium fragments (size >2 mm: 7-8% of total mass of remains and >5mm:
24-25% of total mass of remains) to extinguished pyre (accordingly size >2 mm: 3.5% and >5 mm: 13%). Nearly 80% of fragments gathered from extinguished pyre were over 10 mm long when in case of other pyres only 40-47% of fragments has fallen
in this category. Contrary to popular concepts though the slowly cooling pyre remains had much more solid structure and were
more durable as indicated by increased volume of bone dust gathered after transportation and prolonged storage. This characteristics seems to indicate some significant difference in microstructure and crystallinity of the remains treated differently
during cremation ritual.
