To date, burning has been variously interpreted in funerary contexts in Minoan Crete as an act of fumigation, practical cleansing
of the human bones, or a symbolic practice. Recent excavation of the tholos tomb B at Koumasa in southern Crete revealed a
large number of human remains heavily affected by fire set inside the tomb. A combined set of methodologies regarding the
collection, documentation as well as the macroscopic study and the application of a variety of analytical methods will shed new
light on aspects of the manipulation of the deceased in prepalatial Crete. Issues which will be investigated include the use of fire
in fleshed or partly defleshed body parts, the temperatures reached and the extent and intensity of fire lit inside the tholos tomb
as well as the demographic composition, the levels of health and oral status of the people buried. In particular, the results of the
macroscopic examination of the cremains will be combined with the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) alongside
the oxygen stable isotope analysis in order to record compositional and structural changes in bone, to identify degrees of burning intensity and discrete temperature variation between samples burned in low, medium and high temperatures, to distinguish
burned from unburned bone as well as to investigate the degree of oxygen circulation in the pyre. In parallel, preliminary experimental work in animal cadavers in different stages of decomposition simulating outdoor as well as indoor thermal conditions
have contributed enormously to our understanding and recording of the technology of fire and the changes observed on bone
structure related to the fire. The combined application for the first time in Aegean funerary assemblages affected by intense
fire of state-of-the art analytical tools will revise several stereotypes relating to the manipulation of the deceased in prepalatial
Crete.
