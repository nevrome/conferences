Assessing the MNI of cremated human remains is extremely difficult due to the fragmentary state of the remains found in urns,
pits and other contexts. Often, osteological analyses alone cannot discriminate between different individuals. In this paper, we
present preliminary strontium isotope results from three Roman necropolises from geologically diverse areas from modern-day
Belgium. These results suggest that strontium isotope analysis can contribute to establishing the MNI in cremation graves. By
analysing different bones from the same deposit, such as cranial fragments, diaphysis fragments, rib fragments, and animal
bones, etc., it is possible to gain insights into individuals’ life histories. However, when the strontium isotope data shows completely different signals for bones with similar turnover rate within the same deposit, the results do not seem to correspond with
multiple migration events in the persons’ past. Instead, this suggests the presence of more individuals in the cremation deposit
than determined during the osteological examination. These results offer new perspectives for the application of Sr isotope
analysis in osteology.
