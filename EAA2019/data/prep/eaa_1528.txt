Presentation Format: Poster
Exposure of the body to fire causes various physical and chemical alterations which involve shrinkage, breakage, warping, complete deformation as well as removal of the organic component and the modification of the inorganic crystal component of the
bones. Varying degrees of heat-induced effects predominate on human remains due to fire set up deliberately in direct contact to the human body and these are interpreted as the result of an elaborate and time-consuming procedure widely known
as cremation. Similar effects are also evident when burning is applied on funerary contexts as an act of fumigation, practical
cleansing of the human bones, or a symbolic practice. Variations in the procedure of firing may reflect different social behaviors
and ideological and cosmological attitudes to the human body by the living communities. Regarding ancient Greece, burning of
the human body has been identified almost exclusively with the practice of cremation which until a few years ago the latter was
considered to represent a novel mode of disposal having occurred soon after the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces in the 13th
c. BC. Current presentation aims to trace the evidence of burning of the human remains throughout the prehistoric Aegean and
reconsider the old-standing view of the ‘sudden’ emergence of the practice and its link with exogenous factors. Instead, particular emphasis will be given on the occurrence of cremated remains as early as in the Mesolithic and the Early Neolithic as well as
on the variable intensity of exposure of the human remains in firing conditions throughout the Aegean prehistory. Systematic
collection of the new evidence associated with macroscopic investigation of the cremains will unfold the complexity of the mortuary practices in the Aegean involving more frequently than initially considered the interference of fire with the human remains.
