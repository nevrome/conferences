documented over-wintering of the Viking Great Army at Repton in AD 873-4 and thus, by its very nature, has high potential to
include foreigners to Britain. We used a relatively new method for strontium isotope analysis suitable for cremated bone (Snoeck
et al 2015) in order to explore the origin of a small selection of animals and humans recovered from two mounds. With this poster
we present, for the first time, indications for mobility based on strontium isotopes in cremated individuals and animals from the
early medieval period in Britain. This highlights the potential of the method for other early medieval sites which contain a large
number of cremation burials, but which have so far remained unexplored isotopically.
