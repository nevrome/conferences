… A TOWN IS A TOWN WHEREVER IT IS

Discussions of Iron Age urbanism are under-theorised and tend to take as their measure of what constitutes a town an idealised
model of the classical Mediterranean city. Such an argument has a range of problems. Firstly it perpetuates the illusion of a
classical ideal, secondly it is teleological, presupposing that there is only one outcome of processes of urbanisation and thirdly
it ignores a wide-range of urban phenomena that are historically and ethnographically documented.
This paper will take as its starting point Fernand Braudel’s discussion of Pre-modern towns (in Capitalism and Material Life 14001800 [London: 1973]) to explore what medieval European towns can tell us about Iron Age towns. I will argue that a wide range of
urban phenomena are documented in Pre-modern Europe and that the features of these towns enable us to identify a wide variety or urban phenomena in Iron Age Europe, contributing to the debate on emerging nodes of power in the seventh century BC.
