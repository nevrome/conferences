modification from the previous accent on the manufacture of luxuries by few, for few. It is closely linked to the process of social
stratification and the formation of class societies, some of which endure. Often such central places do not last for centuries on
account of competition and unsustainable social hierarchies for the communities and networks at hand. An illustration of such
developments can be found in Etruria and Old Latium during the 7th century BC. From 700 to 600 BC the main, established centres continue to develop while some other nodes or centres in the exchange networks were hampered in their growth. One can
think of centres such as Verucchio or Marsiliana d’Albegna that probably acted somewhat as staging post or entrepôts, amongst
others in Baltic amber.
