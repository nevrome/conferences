In the 7th century BC larger parts of southern central Europe form part of the Hallstatt culture in its western and eastern specification. Our notion of this period in southern central Europe is still dominated by the impressive grave inventories in large barrow
cemeteries. At least this visualisation of power is not matched by likewise impressive settlement structures in the western Hallstatt sphere. This may in part be the case for taphonomic reasons, but may also reflect a significant shift in social organisation
where – at least in Bavaria – former settlement centres of power seem to have been abandoned. The new Hallstatt habitus of the
7th c. BC in the western Hallstatt world is very much a personalised one, staging a revival of behavioural patterns of the 13th and
12th c. BC in a sepulchral context. Possibly mythological narratives were instrumentalised by certain families to legitimize their
newly gained or emerging status among older power structures. Or, indeed ‘old’ families re-vitalised the role of the Late Bronze
Age wagon-driving, sword bearing warrior to demonstrate their ancestry and thus social predominance. In the eastern Hallstatt
world this type of creating ancestry lines took different shapes. The talk will explore the diverging patterns of social competition
within the 7th c. BC in both regions and ask if ideologically the 7th c. BC is an innovative or rather a traditional period.
