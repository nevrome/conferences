AGE

Presentation Format: Oral
The Mitterkirchen cemetery (ca. 800– 650 BCE) is, besides Hallstatt itself, one of the best-known Early Iron Age sites in western
Austria thanks to its outstanding sumptuous burials and complete excavation in the 1980s. The burial rituals and the composition of the grave goods allow a unique opportunity to evaluate Mitterkirchen in the context of the long discussed societal
developments in the Early Iron Age of Central Europe. Furthermore, Mitterkirchen is situated on the crossroads between what is
classically defined as the western and eastern Hallstatt circles as well on the trade routes of salt from Hallstatt. As such, Mitterkirchen was embedded in several interaction networks that extended way beyond the direct surroundings. The burial rituals
indicate that the Mitterkirchen burials specifically emphasize more western aspects, which in combination with the topographical situation creates a clear ideological border situation. In this paper, I will therefore evaluate the burial rituals from a supraregional perspective and discuss how societal developments, ideologies, borders and interactions across these are reflected and
reinforced in the funerary rituals in Mitterkirchen.
