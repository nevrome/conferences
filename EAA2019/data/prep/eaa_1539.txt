Hubs of the 7th century are usually imagined as being created and maintained by men. As far as the formulation and distribution
of figurative art are concerned, nothing could be further from the truth. When contexts of Central European Hallstatt period
figurative art and patterns of its production and use are analysed a surprisingly clear and dynamic picture of gender roles in the
invention, production and utilisation of figuratively decorated artefacts emerge. At the beginning of the 7th c. BC. women on
the northwestern fringes of the Alps (Kalenderberg Group) decorated symposial vessels in female denoted graves with figural
motives using a schematized formulae illustrating female denoted hierarchical compositions but also narrative themes. By the
century’s close, the context of figurative art production moves from east to west and from pottery vessels to woman´s dress
accessories. Beginning in the innovative hub of the Hallstatt salt mining site male jewellers in the western Hallstatt sphere began using motifs and compositions derived from the Kalenderberg area to decorate bronze costume accessories which would
figurate the bodies of their female patrons. In this paper, I will explore the mechanisms of engendered communication, which are
likely to have included the exchange of figurated textiles, that lie behind this remarkable development.
