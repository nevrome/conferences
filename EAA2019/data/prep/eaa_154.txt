ORGANIZED PATCHWORKS: EXPLORING HERITAGE PARTICIPATION WITH COMBINED METHODOLOGIES
Author(s): Ripanti, Francesco (University of Pisa)
Presentation Format: Oral
Multi-methodological approaches lay at the roots of heritage studies. Drawing from the ‘toolbox approach’ defined by Mason, the
use of different methods and techniques serve in collecting complementary pieces of information with the aim of gaining robust
results, addressing the issues related to conservation, management and promotion.
As well, my PhD research took advantage of the combination of different methods and techniques to study the participation
promoted in three Italian community archaeology projects. This paper wants to describe the workflow used in the research with
different aims: to identify and question the workflow’s strengths and weaknesses; to show how and why the combination of
methods and techniques supports the collection of new data; to report how these data inform some insights suggesting detailed images of participation.
Specific focus will be dedicated to introducing and critically addressing how the interaction between traditional techniques such as interviews, focus groups and value-based stakeholder analysis - and original use of some techniques – for example participation maps, polarised chart, and the use of storytelling for heritage research – assists and enhances the study of heritage
participation.
