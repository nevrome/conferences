The earliest traces of the Hallstatt communities in this area belong to the 8th century BC. However, the 7th century BC is the
time when these communities reach the highest peak of development. This sudden rise of power of local elites is directly connected to the fact that they were immerged in a new communication network that is now established across Europe from Baltic
to Mediterranean. The Iron Age communities of the Požega Valley were deeply rooted in Eastern Hallstatt Cultural Circle and
well-connected with neighbouring areas in the south-eastern Alps and southern Pannonia. However, already the first finds from
Kaptol princely graves suggested that it had strong ties with the south, particularly with northern Bosnia. Numerous items discovered in the Požega Valley were here at their farthest points of distribution within Europe, and those include various types of
weapons, elements of attire and other special-use items. Since elites of individual communities are those who are running and
regulating this communication network, it is primarily reflected in their rich burials, which included some exclusive and prestigious objects brought from far-away places. Kaptol in particular but other sites as well (Kagovac and others) was, over a long period, a very important hub in the Early Iron Age communication network which linked the developed cultural and production centres
of Greece and Italy with rich centres of Hallstatt communities in Central Europe. The close ties between this centre and Iron Age
groups south of the Sava River (such as Donja Dolina and Glasinac), in the eastern Alpine region (Lower Carniola and Styria), and in
the Danube region and Transdanubia, confirm that Golden Valley had a crucial position at the cross-roads between three cultural
spheres: Pannonia, the Alps and the Balkans.
