Presentation Format: Oral
For quite a while the Mures valley, in central Transylvania, was considered like a northern border as concerns the so-called the Basarabi phenomenon / pottery style, which characterises the Middle Hallstatt period. But recently, about 6 years ago, throughout
a large scale rescue excavation followed by a scheduled multidisciplinary research project, he newly discovered site from Tartaria
- Podu Tartariei vest (Alba county) provided substantional discoveries and data which change the perspective for this epoch, in
terms of chronology, characteristic features and long-distance exchange (towards East, on the North Pontic areas, but also to
the Western Balkans). Given the topics announced for the session, the paper will disscus the new 14C obtained on a series of
samples from this site, as well as certain important contexts, assemblages and artefacts, but also the general characteristics
of this site, most probable a centre of power during the 9th to the 7th centuries BC.
