In the VII century BC, in particular its final period, new power centers arise in the Pontic forest-steppe. This place is one of major
areas of concentration of the early Scythian sites in the south of Eastern Europe. A group of the so-called ”royal” burial mounds
emerges here; these kurgans are distinguished by their large height (i.e. 7-20 meters) and can be viewed as symbols of power.
The spatial distribution of these tumuli suggests that several nomadic power centers existed in the forest-steppe Ukraine. One
of these centers was located on the right bank of Dnieper in the Kyiv-Cherkasy region, where the largest burial mounds of the
archaic period (e.g. Glevaha (8.7 m), Perepyatiha (11 m) were found.
Even larger elite kurgans of the early Scythian epoch were discovered on the left bank of Dnieper in the forest-steppe areas.
These burial mounds are mostly concentrated in the Sula river basin. Their height varies from 7-8,5 up to 19-20 m (Starshaya
Mogila, kurgans 10, 11, 14 from Aksyutintsy, etc.).
The emergence of the ”royal” Scythian tumuli marks the peak of power of the Scythians related to their return to Eastern Europe
following the end of Near Eastern military campaigns. The phenomenon of Scythians is related not only to their economic and
social specificity, but also to their role as a connecting link between different cultures and areas.
