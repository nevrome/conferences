the eventual development of the large fortifications at Bel’sk (Gelonus?), an approximately 4000-5000 hectare settlement and
mortuary complex, is the central focus leading to pressing questions, including: how did forest-steppe communities respond to
the socio-economic opportunities presented by the arrival of Greek colonies along the Black Sea littoral around 700/650BCE?
How did these same communities react to the presence of the (sometimes) militant Scythian tribes in the steppe south of the
forest-steppe boundary? What did these reactions/responses mean for community cohesion and the growth of large, possibly
urban, population centers along the forest-steppe boundary? This paper traces the emergence, development, and abandonment
of these large forest-steppe centers with regards to the presence of the Scythians in the Pontic region, ca. 700 – 300 BC.
