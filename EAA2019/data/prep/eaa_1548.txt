Social networks are a well-established concept in Palaeolithic Archaeology to interpret different degrees of regional and interregional interactions among hunter-gatherer populations. However, the heuristic power of the networks approach has been traditionally biased towards its social dimension, empirically grounded in the reconstruction of exchange systems using ornaments
and lithic raw materials. Much less attention has been paid to the use of networks approaches to study diachronic patterns
of cultural transmission and their demographic context. In this contribution, we present aspects of a long-term research programme in the context of the PALEODEM project (ERC-CoG-2015 Ref. 683018), aimed to study cultural transmission processes
from the Upper Magdalenian to the Late Mesolithic in Iberia using formal network approaches and computational methods. In
particular, the work presented here is concerned with the construction of a new georeferenced database of archaeological sites
and cultural attributes which will be used to build spatio-temporal networks. Three categories of artefacts-ornaments, bone and
antler projectiles (harpoons, points and sagaies) and lithic projectiles- have been systematically recorded using bibliographic
sources. The final database compiles the archaeological record from more than 300 Iberian sites.
By constructing and analyzing spatial networks from these robust empirical data, we aim to contribute to the research topic of
the spatial organization of hunter-gatherer groups into regional social networks and its influence on cultural change.
