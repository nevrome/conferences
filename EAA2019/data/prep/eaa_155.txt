A MIXED BAG: DEVELOPING A METHODS ‘TOOLKIT’ FOR ASSESSING THE SOCIAL VALUES OF HERITAGE

Presentation Format: Oral
The social values of heritage are often seen as secondary to ‘objective’, scientific assessments of significance. One of the
reasons proposed for this is the lack of appropriate methods and associated expertise for the assessment of social values
within routine heritage management. Could a multi-methodological approach help practitioners to identify and work with social
values? If so, what are the difficulties in implementing such an approach alongside more established methods of significance
assessment?
This paper considers the above questions through the lens of on-going research to develop a hands-on methodological ‘toolkit’
on the assessment of social value for heritage practitioners. The research is based on a set of comparative case studies, trialling multiple qualitative methodologies and rapid, participatory approaches to assess the social values of a range of historic
places in Scotland. The case study findings will be used to illustrate the problems, challenges and opportunities that arise in
selecting, combining and implementing different methods and techniques. The paper will also touch on some of the institutional
constraints that practitioners have identified when it comes to incorporating multi-methodological approaches to assessing
social value into established ways of working.
It is argued that qualitative, participatory methodologies can complement existing assessment practices; helping to bring plural
and dynamic social values into conservation management practice. However, for these methods to be most effective, heritage
professionals need the scope to work flexibly and the expertise to develop approaches that are responsive to specific social and
conservation contexts.
