The Blätterhöhle cave, discovered in 2004 is noted for Early Mesolithic (9200 - 8700 cal BC) and Late Neolithic (3900-2900
cal BC) human remains and palaeogenetic evidence for Late Neolithic societies based on differing economic strategies. Since
2006 excavations take place within the cave and in a small area of a collapsed rock shelter. Here, for the first time in this region, a
unique Mesolithic stratigraphy was uncovered. In 2016 the first Late Palaeolithic artefacts and faunal remains in a stratigraphic
context were found. Among the lithics a few larger blades and several backed monopoints are striking. Partially backed points
sometimes showing a bent tip are present as well as straight-backed or curved-backed points and small or elongated examples.
Of special interest is a slender tanged point.
This assemblage is highly comparable to the French Épi-Laborien dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene transitional period around
9650 cal BC. The slender and straight backed points called pointes des Blanchères and trapezes are common but so far missing
at the Blätterhöhle. Very similar is the high variability of backed points in the Blätterhöhle and French assemblages and “degenerated” tanged points, both present in the French Épi-Laborien as well. By now the Blätterhöhle lithic assemblage is the most
eastern proof of distinct typo-technological influence by the French Épi-Laborian.
