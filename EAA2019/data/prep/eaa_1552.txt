At the end of the last Ice Age at around 9600 BC rapid climate change of c. 5-10°C occurred within decades, followed by gradual
warming over a 500 year period. This climatic transition has been used by archaeologists to divide the Stone Age into two separate periods: the Palaeolithic during the Ice Age and the Mesolithic following the climate change. Importantly, these changes
have been attributed to Mesolithic hunter-gatherer groups migrating into regions that had previously been populated by Palaeolithic cultures. However: 1) recent research shows that cultural changes do not necessarily align to climatic changes, with
Palaeolithic technology extending into the warming period; and 2) technological change is far from clear cut. Consequently, we
need to re-examine this period.
This PhD project represents a diachronic cross-cultural comparative study of backed point, tanged point, long blade and Early
Mesolithic traditions in northwestern Europe. In order to allow for such a detailed investigation a timeframe of 11,000-9,000
cal BC has been chosen which cuts across the various traditions. As part of this project more than 220 sites are recorded in a
comprehensive database to assess how different traditions relate to each other and to analyse when and why humans did really
change their lifeways. In order to better understand this complex interface, this thesis presents a novel holistic approach which
investigates the various assemblages beyond detailed studies of lithic typologies. This holistic approach includes economic, social and ritual aspects of the lives of lateglacial and early postglacial hunter-gatherers thereby enabling a detailed reconstruction
of developments and changes during the Pleistocene-Holocene interface.
