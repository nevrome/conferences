In northern Germany, the last Final Palaeolithic tradition is the Ahrensburgian and the Early Mesolithic of the region is generally
associated with the Maglemosian technocomplex. The relation of the Ahrensburgian to the Early Mesolithic tradition in this region remains unclear as they display several similarities on a broad-scale such as the use of lithic blade techniques, microliths,
and organic harpoons but differences in the details. Hence, although these technocomplexes are rather different, it is challenging to detect the exact turning point from one to the other. For instance, we can date single lines of evidence but brought
together we need to raise the question: When has enough changed to make a change? One reason why this differentiation remains difficult may be that we often identify these technocomplexes in their most distinct versions, whereas the majority of our
material is less distinctive and/ or originates from potential palimpsests.
We assemble the different lines of palaeoenvironmental and archaeological evidence to show the relatively large margin and
compare inventories from this transformation period using a quantitative as well as a qualitative approach to the northern German archaeological record. Based on this approach, we exemplify a broader behavioural change from a more curated to a more
expedient behaviour that may be one of the reasons for our difficulties to untangle these interrelated traditions.
