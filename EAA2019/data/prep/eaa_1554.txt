We present a study of variability in morphological and metrical attributes of the projectile inventory from the Final Palaeolithic
to the Middle Mesolithic (10 900-7000 BC) in Northwest Europe, and compare this with the simultaneous development in blade
production methods. The study is based on technological and morphological analysis from 43 excavated sites in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Northwest Germany.
Until recently, the Stone Age of Northwest Europe has mainly been investigated by using typological approaches to formal tool
types. This has resulted in delimitation of a large number of regional archaeological groups. Projectile point typology has been
central to this research. However, recent technological studies of lithic blade technology challenge this picture by demonstrating a shared and uninterrupted tradition of blade-making throughout the Final Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic, indicating technological relatedness within large areas. Simultaneously we see alterations in technological elements such as projectile types
which show a gradual increase in regional variability and reduced levels of standardisation. Further, after this long period of gradual development and relative technological continuity, abrupt and fundamental alterations are identified in the blade production
methods and projectile inventory around 8300-8200 BC in parts of the area. We present new results from a statistical analysis
of the projectile inventory, documenting a trajectory somewhat divergent from the development of blade production methods.
Finally, we discuss how the two datasets combined can offer a new understanding of interaction dynamics and the culture-historical development of the Stone Age of Northwest Europe.
