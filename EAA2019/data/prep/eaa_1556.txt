Projectile points, representing one of the most distinctive tool forms in lithic collections, can serve as an important diagnostic
factor to determine the presence of a certain archaeological industry or culture in a region. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to
present Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic (11th – 9th millennium BC) lithic projectile points from present-day Latvia, focusing on both morphological and technological attributes as well as on dating problems.
It is possible to divide flint projectile points from Latvia (67 in total) into four main types, all produced from non-local, high-quality Cretaceous flint. Even though each type has its own specific characteristics, some of them share common technological
attributes.
The first two types – tanged and willow-leaf points – are associated with the banks of two major rivers, the Daugava and Lielupe,
representing the Swiderian technological tradition (Salaspils Laukskola and Avotiņi sites). Both tanged and willow-leaf points
were produced from the same blank type. Based on similar material in the Baltic region, the tanged type is assigned to the Late
Palaeolithic, while the willow-leaf type is dated to the end of the Late Palaeolithic and beginning of the Mesolithic. However, due
to the lack of datable material on sites, it is not possible to determine the exact time these points were in use in present-day
Latvia. Two other tanged point types – long, regular and smaller forms – are the Pulli types and have been found as stray finds in
the River Daugava basin and at Early Mesolithic sites in NE (Zvejnieki II) and SE (Kvapani II) Latvia, dated to the 9th millennium BC.
