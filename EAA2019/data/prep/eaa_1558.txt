For over a decade now, the field of paleogenomics has been a key source of information for studies of prehistoric human mobility
and dispersal. Although the samples of ancient DNA in these studies derive from archaeological contexts, and interpretations
of the sources of detected genomic variation are made using archaeological cultures as background information, due to variety
of reasons archaeological discussion is rarely at the centre of papers that combine DNA and archaeology. With this in mind, we
discuss the Early Mesolithic in Scandinavia, a case where cultural variability is great in the archaeological record but not necessarily fully grasped in studies that have attempted to combine genes and culture to create a model of early postglacial human
dispersal.
A common problem for all DNA studies concentrating on Mesolithic north-western Europe, is that the currently available sample
material postdates the archaeologically identified timing of the pioneer colonization process and many of the subsequent cultural processes that took place alongside and after the region had been occupied. In this presentation we present an up-to-date
synthesis of available archaeological data from Fennoscandia predating 7500 cal BCE and discuss it in relation to the current
model of single event gene-culture co-dispersal. We specifically scrutinize the idea that the eastern component detected in
Mesolithic Scandinavian hunter-gatherers in studies of ancient DNA can be directly linked to a single population event evidenced
by the spread of eastern pressure blade technology along the Norwegian Atlantic coast.
