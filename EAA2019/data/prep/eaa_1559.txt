Presentation Format: Oral
Genome-wide aDNA sequences where obtained from three individuals from birch tar ”chewing gums” dated to ca. 8200-7600
BC, originated from the Huseby Klev site on the Swedish west coast. They group together with earlier investigated Scandinavian
Mesolithic individuals (Scandinavian hunter-gatherer, SHG), thereby enlarging the chronological and geographical extension of
this group. The origin of the SHG genetic group is supposed to be an eastern admixture to an earlier western hunter-gatherer population (WHG) in Scandinavia. This Early Postglacial dual-route colonization of the Scandinavian Peninsula is largely based on dispersal of lithic technology from the East European Plain. According to this view the mixing should have taken place some 1000500 years before 1000-500 years before the Huseby Klev individuals were living. Do the genetic results fit with this scenario?
Human DNA from mastics provides a clear connection between material culture and genetic data. DNA from different types of
mastics can be used to study food-stuffs and oral microbiome of prehistoric populations.
