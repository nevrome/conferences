The transition to the Mesolithic in Southern Scandinavia is for many reasons a difficult question to handle: the definition of the
Mesolithic is not clear, the radiocarbon dating of the Younger Dryas/Early Holocene is imprecise and the finds with stratigraphic
and palynological evidence are few. In the paper it is argued, that: 1) The categorical definition of the Palaeolithic versus the
Mesolithic is not feasible in order to characterize the social and cultural change during the period., 2) Several methodological
perspectives needs to be applied on the period concerning e.g.; technology, typology, environment, geology, absolute dating,
palynology., 3) A large Northwest European perspective needs to be applied.
In light of these problems and methodological challenges it is argued that a relevant interpretation of cultural change in South
Scandinavia during this period can concern two social traditions; the “Long Blade Complex” and the “Early Mesolithic”, both rooted in Late Palaeolithic/ Late Glacial Cultures. Moreover, that these two traditions partly are separated in time, regionalism and
in their life style i.e., concerning economy and environmental adaptation. However, that their interrelatedness remains unclear.
