ture constructs’ archaeological analysis is based on. One focus will be on the individual culture’s internal variation as well as unity
with regard to typology, style, linguistic details, and taste down to the small-scale level in some cases within one household.
Another focus will be on a central force behind this dynamic system which is the creation and maintenance of personal and group
identity at all scale levels. A third focus will be on the interaction different groups from the clan level and up, including some territoriality issues such as changing clan-territories, strategies for collecting information about ‘foreign areas’, and the exploitation
of new areas. One part of the explanation of the difference between archaeological and live reindeer-hunting cultures can be
that ephemeral materials (skin, fur, bark, wood, bone, etc.) are preferred for dynamic social signaling as opposed to the generally
well-preserved lithics which are much more difficult to vary.
