Late Pleistocene/early Holocene Europe is said to be the ideal laboratory for the investigation of human responses to rapidly
changing climates and environments, migration and adaptation. Yet, pinpointing precisely how and why contemporaneous Final Palaeolithic/earliest Mesolithic (15,000-11,000 years BP) foragers migrated, and which environmental or other factors they
adapted to – or failed to – has remained remarkably elusive. The European Research council recently decided to fund CLIOARCH,
a 5-year project focused on this period. At the core of CLIOARCH is the radical but, in light of research-historical insights, necessary hypothesis that much of the current archaeological cultural taxonomy for this period is epistemologically flawed and that
interpretations based on this traditional taxonomy – especially those that seek to relate observed changes in material culture
and land-use to contemporaneous climatic and environmental changes – are therefore problematic. Hence, novel approaches to
crafting the taxonomic building blocks are required, as are novel analyses of human-environment relations in this period. CLIOARCH’s aim is to provide operational cultural taxonomies for the Final Palaeolithic/earliest Mesolithic of Europe and to couple
these with interdisciplinary cultural evolutionary, quantitative ecological methods and field archaeological investigations beyond the state-of-the-art, so as to better capture such adaptations – almost certainly with major implications for the standard
culture-historical narrative relating to this period. In so doing, the project will pioneer a fully transparent and replicable – and eminently transferable – methodology for the study of the impacts, or lack thereof, of climate change and extreme environmental
events in prehistory.
