UPDATE

Presentation Format: Oral
In Portugal, the Late Pleistocene industries, traditionally assigned to the Magdalenian technocomplex, are characterized by profuse bladelet production and a huge variety of microlith types. Those have been conventionally used to establish the chronocultural sequence and are usually perceived not only as cultural markers but also as a source to understand adaptative strategies.
Previous works showed that the same debitage strategies were used during a long diachrony and usually the different microlith
typology resulted from blank transformation by retouch. The regional variability has been explained by an adaptation of local
groups to different raw material environments. Using a new grid analysis (combining morphology, metric, technic and functional
analysis), gathering data from recently excavated sites and comparing the identified cultural phases with climate changes we
will revise information on the Late Pleistocene in the western fa√ßade of Iberia producing an updated synthesis on the lithic tool
kits used by the last Pleistocene hunter-gatherers.
