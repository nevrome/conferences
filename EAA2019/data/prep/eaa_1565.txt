Presentation Format: Poster
The chert of a small number of assemblages of the Final Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic has been analyzed by an geologist.
The stone material could thus be attributed to specific outcrops. There seem to be differences between the Palaeolithic and
Mesolitic procurement strategy.
Main source is the souther hill foot of the Jura Mountains, mainly the areas of Olten and Lägeren. Oltenm seem to be the main
source during the Mesolithic, Lägeren during the Final Palaeolithic. Contact to the Alpine Area are shown by rock Crystal, to the
western part of Austria through the precense of radiolarite from the Klein- and Grosswalsertal-vallies. The are chert present
originating from the Soutrher Alps and Western Switzerland, as well.
Typological Analysis Show a cultural Group in the Swiss Plateau, in the Early Mesolithic the Groups seem to be more local restricted. All sites of the Final Paleolithic yielded more than 50% burins. Typical of the Early Mesolithic is the dominance of oblique
retouched points.
