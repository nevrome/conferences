Heidenschmiede is a rockshelter in Heidenheim at the Brenz river, in the eastern part of the Swabian Jura. The site was originally
discovered and excavated by the amateur researcher. Due to a disturbance by a medieval wall and the insufficient excavation
methods, the site is unstratified. The following excavator Eduard Peters classified the finds as belonging to the Acheulian and
the Mousterian, with some pieces being of microlithic character. According to later resaerchers only the Middle Paleolithic is
documented at the site.
Since the archaeological remains have never been completely analyzed, the fauna and the lithic material of the Heidenschmiede
are currently being re-evaluated by S. Münzel and by the author herself.
The assemblage shows a wide range of Middle Paleolithic tools, including various scraper types, several bifacial and unifacial
tools such as handaxes, Keilmesser and points, as well as some so called “Groszaki”.
The non-bifacial technological strategies are represented by several Levallois flake and blade cores as well as by non-Levallois
blades and cores. The length-width ratios indicate that elongated flakes and blades are an important component of the assemblage. This is unique for the Swabian Jura.
14 C-Dates from three bone samples are at the limit of radiocarbon dating and therefore probably indicate the late Middle Paleolithic origin of the finds. This is in line with the techno-typological features at that time in the cave sites of the Swabian Jura and
in the neighboring regions such as the adjacent Franconian Jura.
It can be noted that an extensive non-Levallois blade technology in the Swabian Jura is proven for the first time at the Heidenschmiede.
