CLEARING UP A MESS WITH THE ANALYSIS OF CONCEPTS AND DISCOURSES
Author(s): Enqvist, Johanna (University of Helsinki)
Presentation Format: Oral
This talk presents a methodological approach that draws from sociocognitive approaches of terminology and critical discourse
studies to create analytical tools for dissection and critical assessment of the conceptual and theoretical framework of heritage studies. The perspective suggested here is based on an idea that heritage scholars represent a specialised epistemic
community that shares a knowledge system which is organised and structured by hierarchical categories of concepts (or ‘units
of understanding’). Concepts and their linguistic representations – terms – thus reflect how knowledge is structured in the experts’ minds in particular social settings i.e. discourses, that is context-specific frameworks for making sense of some aspect
of reality.
Therefore, the essential key to the investigation of the structure, accumulation and interdisciplinary links of research knowledge, or the socio-political and cultural impact of that knowledge for that matter, lies in the analysis of the concepts and the multiple discourses in and to which they emerge, transfer, transform and attach. Furthermore, concepts are considered as culturally,
bodily and perceptually based; metaphorical models link the language system to the world of experience and to the functioning
of the mind. Consequently, and in contrast to the understandings and criticisms of discourse as solely linguistic and thus exterior to material reality, the concept of discourse is regarded as a multi-modal, multi-semiotic and historically contingent social
practice.
As a pragmatic solution and practical application for analysing and representing knowledge that is concentrated in the concepts,
this talk also introduces a multilingual and multidisciplinary research infrastructure project “The Helsinki Term Bank for the Arts
and Sciences” (HTB) coordinated at the University of Helsinki. The HTB maintains a wiki-based, constantly updated website (tieteentermipankki.fi) which offers a collaborative platform for terminological work and conceptual analysis for experts and a
discussion forum available for all registered users.
