The appearance of large-blade bidirectional production is associated with a significant event known as the Initial Upper Paleolithic in eastern Central Asia, marked not only by critical changes in lithic technology, but by specific tool assemblages as well.
This event was so distinct from both ancestral and descendant technocomplexes, that it presupposes the in-migration of a
population or populations bearing this technology into eastern Central Asia, including Mongolia, eastern Kazakhstan, Xinjiang
and the Transbaikal region of Siberia, probably from the Russian Altai Mountains. Blades were intensively used as tool blanks,
having already appeared in local Terminal Middle Paleolithic industries in some of these regions, especially Mongolia. Levallois
point production, well-developed at this stage, required preparation of the flaking surfaces of cores by removing marginal blades,
thus, in this case, blades were generated as a secondary product. There is some limited evidence of targeted blade production in
