Terminal Middle Paleolithic assemblages along with Levallois technology. The Terminal MP falls between >50,000–43,000 ya and
is partially overlapped by an IUP presence in eastern Central Asia from 45,000–37,000 ya. Considering Terminal MP complexes
with Levallois technology and blades as distinct from IUP complexes, we suggest the existence of, minimally, two blade production traditions. From this point of view, IUP laminar technology was “intrusive” into eastern Central Asia. Considering the origin
of blades in eastern Central Asia, we not only raise technological questions, but also make preliminary inferences regarding the
anthropological context of those technologies’ bearers.
