Presentation Format: Poster
The blades production is a turning point in the lithic record and reflects development of technological capabilities of Paleolithic
humans. Many results from many sites throughout Levant and Europe showed that they were rich in blades.
A systematic production of blades appeared in the Levant during the transition from the Lower to Middle Paleolithic. Two distinct
blade industries were distinguished in the LLP, Pre-Aurignacian and Amudian were first recognized at Yabrud I and Tabun cave.
