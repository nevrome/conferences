These blade industries have been associated with term Acheluo-Yabrudian and dated back to between 400. – 200.000. Many
more sites have been found to contain both in their stratigraphies. The subsequent EMP industries also contained a systematic
production of blades. In spite of the differing names; Hummalian, Abou Sif, or Tabun D. The EMP blade productions showed many
similarities in technological and typological characteristics and dated to around 200.000.
In the northwest of Europe, development skills and new technological features emerged during the shifting from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic. Predetermined flaking systems and more complex core reduction strategies increased during
Middle Paleolithic e.g. the laminar, Levallois productions and many other. The oldest laminar production in the northwest of Europe dated back to the Early Middle Paleolithic roughly between 300 to 250.000 that corresponds to the MIS8 and 7. Many
sites showed substantial numbers of laminar elements e.g. Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, Baker’s Hole, Rissori, Rheindahlen, Tourville-la-Riviere, Veldwezelt-Hezerwater. etc.
The time frame relating to the emergence of blades in the Levant and the northwest of Europe and their techno-typological
pattern shows different characteristics. In this poster, the comparison of the emergence of blades in the Levant and in the
northwest of Europe will allow us to gain a better understanding of the blade productions of the Middle Pleistocene and discuss
variability during this period.
