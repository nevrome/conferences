ARCHAEOLOGY IN SCHOOLS. INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES IN COMPARISON
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Mathis, Christian (Zurich University of Teacher Education) - Egea Vivancos, Alejandro - Arias Ferrer, Laura (University of Murcia) - Pinto, Helena (University of Porto)
Format: Regular session
Despite the fact that archaeologists have tried to offer students the perspective that archaeology is everywhere, traditionally,
the material sources have been seen as most useful teaching material to «illustrate» the historical content instead of being
introduced as sources to be analysed.
Visiting an archaological site or museum has been regarded as an act of perception and reception of information in order to enhance students’ motivation. The students’ agency in this kind of learning process is usually quite low.
However, in the last decade this view has been challenged. It is argued that the introduction of archaeological methodology in
formal educational settings proves to be a valuable and effective resource for historical learning. Furthermore, it allows to implement enquiry based strategies to teaching and learning as well as understanding the importance of preserving archaeological
heritage by means of assessing its value as a source of knowledge.
This session will deal with approaches from different countries on how to integrate archaeology and its methodology together
with material culture into classroom practices. There will also be a focus on the process of reconstruction: from the prospection,
to finds, to sources, to interpretations, and presentations in a narrative. This includes formal teaching at archaeological sites.
We invite contributions which discuss how to incorporate archaeological methodology, sites, monuments, and artefacts as well
as the importance of cultural heritage for society into the history classroom.
