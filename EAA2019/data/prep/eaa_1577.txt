The research presented in this paper is based on a longitudinal study (2012 to present) of an archeological experience in a Secondary School in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with the aim of designing instructional experiences that include secondary students as active agents in historical discourse. As part of the recreation of an archaeological site, investigators designed and
developed a sequence of interdisciplinary activities intended to introduce students to archaeological concepts, competencies
and skills. Further, the program involved the development of educational objectives and contents not only related to the social
sciences, but also integrated across a wide range of disciplines.
The introduction of direct work with archaeological evidence resulted in the improvement of the teaching-learning process, especially in relation to history. The drastic transformation of in-class history lessons to an outside-laboratory where the students
search, classify, analyze, reflect and interpret information from found objects supported the development of historical thinking
skills. Further, as students worked with small artifacts representative of personal stories and global history, they expressed
interest in and increased their awareness of issues related to cultural heritage. Objects turned into small pieces of history that
students perceived as worthy of preservation. They came to describe such objects as having intrinsic value and their sense of
the worth of such objects grew over the course of their study.
In comparing results with similar initiatives at different educational levels and in different contexts, developed with more complexity and infrastructures or with scarce resources, the introduction of the archaeological methodology in educational settings
