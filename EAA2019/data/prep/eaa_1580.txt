Presentation Format: Oral
Observing objects in a museum or in a historic site can be an interesting and outstanding educational experience to stimulate
students’ historical thinking through the interpretation of sources related to various aspects of the life of a human community
in the past. Concurrently, if the sensory manipulation and exploration of objects, and specifically the archaeological ones, can
be provided, value-added strategies may allow students to have experience enriching learning. Concerning this starting point,
the research question that guided the study here presented was: How do seventh grade students make historical sense of
replicas of archaeological objects of the Roman era? Grounded on an essentially qualitative research, this study focused on the
perspectives of the participants both with respect to the uses and to the meanings of the archaeological objects for them and
for the communities that made and handled those objects. The study was carried out in the history classroom, with about eighty
students of compulsory secondary education (seventh grade) in the north of Portugal. Results from data analysis of students’
answers to a set of questions specifically designed to evaluate students’ interpretations, revealed that archaeological objects
can be interesting and thought-provoking sources to interpret the past. Several students revealed to interpret sources, making
inferences based on previous knowledge and making conjectures about social, economic or cultural aspects. The study highlights that manipulation and sensory exploration of objects, and specifically archaeological objects, are strategies that allow
memories to be activated and very fruitful learning experiences to take place. Furthermore, the use of replicas in the classroom
stimulates students’ curiosity and encourages a visit to the museum or to the interpretive centre where real archaeological
objects are exhibited.
