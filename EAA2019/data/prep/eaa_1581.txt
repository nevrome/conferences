PROJECT ARCHAEOLOGY: INVESTIGATING HOUSING AS A CIVIC ISSUE
Author(s): Henderson, A Gwynn - Stottman, M. (Kentucky Archaeological Survey)
Presentation Format: Oral
The entanglement of humans and objects challenges educators to think more carefully about what educational frameworks
might help students recognize the interplay of human intelligence, ingenuity, innovation, and agency. This is particularly crucial
with respect to protecting archaeological sites that serve as primary data for studying past peoples, especially in pre-literate
societies. Such understanding is also central to informed civic decision-making, a broad goal of public schooling as well as the
guiding purpose of social studies education.
The authors developed and piloted an instructional unit focused on how shotgun houses could illuminate the lives of the working
poor in an historically integrated community. The unit was developed as part of Project Archaeology: Investigating Shelter, a
national, inquiry-based curriculum that emphasizes archaeological questions, sources and investigatory techniques to support
a preservation ethic. Studies suggest that archaeological inquiry enhances studentsâ€™ ability and/or inclination to analyze the
connections between human intelligence, innovation, agency and related civic behaviors.
