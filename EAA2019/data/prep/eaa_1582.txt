This study took place in four rural Kentucky Appalachian counties. Each county had experienced serious instances of archaeological site destruction. Both of these factors highlight the increasing body of research indicating that school community influences how subject matter is taught and learned.
Investigators developed the shotgun shelter unit in collaboration with teachers who piloted it in grades five-seven. The presentation follows the four teachers as they adapt the unit to their instructional settings and analyze the unit’s effectiveness in
their classrooms. Analysis of teacher surveys, individual teacher interviews, and full group interviews suggests that implementing and sustaining inquiry-based instruction was challenging in regard to sustaining focus on the guiding questions and that the
civic implications of students’ investigations were more often overlooked than any other part of the inquiry. Interviews with
teachers provide insights into contextual factors that influenced how teachers implemented a new curriculum.
