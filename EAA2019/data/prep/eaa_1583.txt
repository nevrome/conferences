Presentation Format: Oral
We all relate to objects and learn through experiencing through them. The tangibility of the material nature of objects makes
them adequate from the educational point of view, both in the formal and non-formal spheres. We can relate the characteristics
of the object with more general concepts, and reach conclusions about the historical, social and cultural context in which it
was made and used. The exploratory study here reported, of a qualitative nature, has been carried out with a group of ±15-yearold students of secondary education, participating in a hands-on activity and a planned visit to the Museum of Archaeology D.
Diogo de Sousa, Braga, Northern Portugal. The research focused on the interpretation of archaeological artefacts by a specific
audience – secondary education students – aiming at understanding how a hands-on activity with archaeological artefacts may
develop students’ skills to interpret objects displayed in a museum exhibition. Students were invited to participate in a hands
on-activity, previous to a planned visit to the museum, and they were asked to select three objects from a cluster of displayed
artefacts, and share their views, ideas, and thoughts about them, when responding to a set of questions. Data analysis has been
revealing that most of participants’ answers exceeded the simple observation of the object, and in some cases have shown a
contextualized interpretation of the social and human relations established by the communities of the past and the present.
Likewise, interpreting artefacts may activate students’ personal memories and identity connections with their own and other
communities.
