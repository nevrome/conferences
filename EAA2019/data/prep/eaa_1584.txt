EXCURSION INTO THE PAST: LEARNING AT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeological sites such as the medieval ruins above the village make traces of history in one’s surrounding area accessible and
tangible. Their authenticity fascinates and motivates children to look and ask questions.
Furthermore, learning at archaeological sites leads pupils out into the landscape, where traces of human activity (e.g. parts of
buildings, ruins, landscape transformations) have been preserved. These archaeological phenomena become pivotal points for
the students’ active engagement with the local space (e.g. perceive, describe, question etc.).
In addition, learning at archaeological sites is supported by the mandatory Swiss «curriculum 21» emphasizing historical, spacial
and material perspectives on one’s own environment already at primary school level (D-EDK 2016).
Moreover, learning at archaeological sites incorporates the principle of multi-perspectivity, which demands a discursive discussion of content and different perspectives on reality.
Thus, children learn to think academically, to discuss perspectives, explore and examine the world. Here, the pupils’ learning processes are guided by learning task. They activate their knowledge and help to change, expand and enrich it (Mathis et al. 2017).
The paper is about a project on teaching materials for learning at archaeological sites in the students’ local area. The focus is
on «best practice»-task settings which, within the framework of the competence orientated teaching, lead to successful and
lasting archaeological learning.
