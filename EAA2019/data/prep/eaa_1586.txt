important new results on the emergence of Pictish power centres and society in the late Roman and early medieval period and is
undertaking new survey work in Ireland on sites of royal power. Environmental data through pollen is also being produced to assess the impacts that royal sites had on the landscape and new Bayesian frameworks are being developed to assess the timings
and tempos of social and political change.
In this session the Comparative Kingship project will present the early results of the project. As part of our comparative approach
we invite colleagues to present studies from Europe that addresses the rise of late and post-Roman polities in the first millennium AD that showcase:
•
The materiality and spatiality of power in the first millennium AD
•
New archaeological data on first millennium AD seats of power
•
How different data sources such as place-name studies and archaeology can be combined
•
Critiques of, or models for, state formation
•
The impact of new social and political formations on how the landscape and environment was utilised
•
Trans-regional or trans-national studies comparing state formation processes.
