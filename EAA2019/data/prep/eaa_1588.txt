TAKING A LINE FOR A WALKER: A NEW PICTISH SCULPTURE FROM TULLOCH, SCOTLAND AND THE
IDEOLOGY OF KINGSHIP AND WARRIORS
Author(s): Hall, Mark (Perth Museum)
Presentation Format: Oral
This talk will introduce a recently discovered Pictish sculptural find from Tulloch, Perth, Scotland (a chance discovery during
road works). This rare example of an early Pictish figurative sculpture depicts a spear-bearing figure, which falls into a class of
so-called ritual walkers. This new piece will be assessed against the broader group of such sculptures and more specifically
against four key sculptures: Rhynie, Aberdeenshire; Newton of Collessie, Fife; Westerton, Angus and Kilmorack, Inverness-shire.
These will be considered for the potential insights they offer into the warrior ideology underpinning and supporting early medieval kingship/leadership and the wider social hierarchy it was part of, which in part looked to spear-wielding deities/supernatural
entities. Comparison will be drawn with contemporary and temporally distant parallels from Europe and the Near East (including
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Scandinavia and Germany). Links with the monumental landscape and its territorial development will also
be postulated to affirm the discussion around the social hierarchies of kings and warriors.
