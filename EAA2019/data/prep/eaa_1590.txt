limited work undertaken in the interior and on the environs of the site. Similarly, the unrecorded enclosure complex at Rhynie has
recently been identified as an important Pictish power centre, and continued work in the environs of this complex has began to
contextualise the wider landscape of this 5th to 6th century power centre. In Northern Ireland, Dunserverick, a stunning promontory on the northern coast of Co. Antrim has been identified as one of the major royal seats of the Dál Riata dynasty. However,
no modern excavation or survey work has been undertaken on the promontory. In Munster the Rock of Cashel was the centre
of the Eóganachta. Recent survey at Cashel has revealed an extensive series of unrecorded archaeological features indicative
of a vast complex in the immediate vicinity of the Rock of Cashel. The character of these new features suggests the location
developed from a major fortified site during the 5th and 6th century AD, and was later transformed into a major ceremonial seat
of kingship and of the early Church. The talk will outline our current understanding of each site and reflect on the ways in which
we can begin to study these power centres on a comparative level.
