on recent fieldwork at Cashel and other sites in Munster, it analyses the materiality and spatiality of power, authority, and rulership in late Roman to Viking Age European society. By exploring how programmes of construction and monumental investment
were implicated in strategies of rulership, it examines the wider context of political discourse and its evolution as a critique of
state formation frameworks in archaeology more generally.
