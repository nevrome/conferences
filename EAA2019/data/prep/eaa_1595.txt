THE LOST KINGDOMS OF THE POST-ROMAN NORTH CHANNEL

Even though the historical data are often back-projected and unreliable and the associated archaeological evidence frustratingly
low resolution, comparatively much can be said of the overkingdoms on either side of the body of water connecting the Irish Sea
to the Atlantic Ocean. However, this paper intends to look beyond well-known groups such as the Dál Riata, Dál Fiatach and Dál
nAraide to the polities they displaced or incorporated in the historiographical record, if not the landscape itself. To do so, the
results of a long-term project that sought to refine settlement distributions in time and space in the North Channel in the Iron
Age and medieval period using archaeological, textual and toponymic evidence will be employed. It will be demonstrated in this
paper that the cloud of ink associated with the better-known overkingdoms obscures several other polities. A source-critical
transdisciplinary approach makes it possible to identify information related to these ‘lost’ kingdoms and how they were later
written out of the historical record and what traces they have left on the landscape. Understanding their form and obsolescence
c.AD400–600 is key to understanding how the later state of affairs came about and might potentially provide a model for identifying other polities in Ireland, Britain and Continental Europe subsumed due to similar processes.
