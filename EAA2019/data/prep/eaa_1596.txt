The Danish place name Gudme means ‛the home of the Gods’ but why did this place get its name? In order to elucidate this
question, we combine the Gudme (Funen, Denmark) area´s place names with the area´s landscape development (based on palynological data) and settlement history (based on archaeological data) during the first millennium AD. All archaeological find
locations and relevant place names are collated in a data base and a recent pollen analysis from Lake Gudme shows the history
of the landscape development. In the paper we argue that in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the sacral landscape a
settlement-historical perspective must be established. In combining evidence of land-use, settlement history and place names,
the paper discusses the background for the coining of the name Gudme. Together, the evidence provides important insights into
the long-term development of Gudme both as a settlement area and as a concept.
