EMERGING FROM THE SHADOWS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDIEVAL PARISHES IN AN EARLY CHRISTIAN LANDSCAPE
Author(s): Johnson, Andrew (Manx National Heritage)
Presentation Format: Oral
The earlier medieval religious landscape on the Isle of Man is characterised by small chapels, burial grounds and associated
monuments, particularly carved stone crosses. About 170 chapels and more than 200 crosses are known, within an island of just
580km². The long eleventh century saw great change in the island’s religious landscape. Cross-carving, having reached levels of
artistic skill and iconographic content which continues to attract international attention, came to an apparently abrupt end, and
the extensive network of early chapels and burial grounds were abandoned in favour of just 17 parishes.
The application of GIS, map-regression and landscape survey is beginning to make sense of some of the contributory factors and
decision-making that led to the selection of a handful of sites as the centres of these new parishes. These include accessibility
within a predominantly agricultural landscape, proximity to the coast, visibility from the sea, and existing significance as indicated by the presence of earlier pagan Viking burial monuments and stone crosses. The creation of several church estates, for
the first time taking land out of secular administrative control, also contributes to the interest of a medieval religious landscape
emerging from the shadows of a long early Christian era.
