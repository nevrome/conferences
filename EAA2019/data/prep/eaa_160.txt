benefit of future generations”, since the 1980s, CHM has been embedded in a dominant ideological-economic system, namely:
neoliberalism or hyper-capitalism, which is not necessarily compatible with the latter definition. In fact, practitioners have been
increasingly pressured in mimicking both efficiency and quantifiability of modern-management to avoid slowing-down development activities, ultimately reshaping CHM to make it compatible with profits making and economic growth.
Most CHM specialists, including archaeologists in CRM, had no alternative but to adapt by embracing a simplistic (but self-preserving) “sustained optimism” (Hutchings 2018:80) in defining their missions, i.e. assuming that technical solutions can be
found, and “sustainable” compromises can be achieved between development and preservation of archaeological heritage.
Yet, the failures of such a model have been countless since the 1990s and the attempts to instrumentalise its use to serve
the interests of specific stakeholders has been equally uncountable (notably through the colonization of the vocabulary; e.g.,
the use of the oxymora: “sustainable development” and “resource management”). As such, defining a future for archaeological
heritage management in such context is problematic.
Likewise, it is now apparent that the ongoing global ecological disaster we are facing cannot be reversed with compromises but
rather with a frontal resistance against the injunction of economic growth. Whether it is ecology, CHM or archaeology, it is now
time for a “radical engagement” truly challenging the neoliberal self-destructive order. To do so, I intend exploring the concept of
“degrowth” to propose a new paradigm for our discipline by a change in CHM practices opposing the logic of economic growth.
