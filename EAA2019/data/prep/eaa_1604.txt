NEW WAYS OF FIGHTING EROSION IN A LAKESHORE SETTLEMENT

The lakeshore settlement of Sutz Rütte lies on the southern shore of Lake Bienne in the Canton of Berne. Since 2011, it belongs
to the UNESCO world heritage “Pile Dwellings Around the Alps.” An excellent example of a late Neolithic pile dwelling, it offers
well-preserved archaeological layers containing organic material, including textiles.
Artificial lowering of the water level brought the submerged remains of the village into the erosion zone in the late 19th century.
A pronounced decline of the extension of the archaeological site accompanied by a significant loss of organic matter became
apparent during the last decades. Indirectly caused by human impact, the main problem is the erosion caused by waves during
westerly storms.
The topographic cape situation open to the predominant wind direction renders traditional protection ineffective. Within years,
the currents transported the gravel brought in as a test away from the site. An attempt to stabilise the situation with a wooden
fence used in reed protection proved too weak to withstand the wave force.
The archaeological service of the Canton of Berne thus launched a project together with the EPFL of Lausanne to evaluate a more
durable solution. A detailed bathymetric model and a wave and current simulation allow us to understand the forces at work. In
close collaboration with engineers and important players affected by the project, we developed a possible solution. The goal is
to implement environmentally acceptable measures during the next years.
