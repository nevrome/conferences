HANGING THERE – BUT FOR HOW LONG?

Coastal erosion due to climate change is an increasing problem in Denmark. According to the Danish Culture Agency in 2018, 711
scheduled monuments were located within 50 meters of the coastline and app. 92 were affected by erosion. A lot of the monuments probably contains very well preserved archaeological material and good opportunities exists to save important finds,
gain new information and secure material for future research. But they are at the same time protected by law, and archaeological
excavation is rarely permitted. It is possible to protect some of the monuments with different types of coastal protection. But
how do we choose who’s to live and who’s to die? How do we get as much information for the archaeological record as possible,
before the evidence is lost to the sea forever? In 2016 the Museums of Eastern Funen undertook an exploratory investigation of
a Bronze Age barrow, which for the last century had been eroded by the sea. In 2014 parts of a full hilted bronze sword fell down
on the beach and it became increasingly clear, that the barrow most likely wouldn’t survive another decade. Looking at older
maps and LIDAR-scans the erosion history was established. Approximately 50 percent of the barrow had already disappeared.
The barrow was situated on a brink 11 meters above sea level and the situation demanded alternative methods and means of
investigation. Taking advantage of the fact, that nature had already created a profile through the barrow an investigation involving hydraulic lifts with crawler feet was performed. A thorough photogrammetric registration of the barrow profile combined
with micromorphological analyses and pollen analyses resulted in new insights in barrow building methods and in agricultural
development in the region.
