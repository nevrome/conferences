SOUTH NORWAY

Wetlands make out c. 5 % (19 000 km2) of Norway’s land surface, and about 7 % of the country’s farmland area is defined as
wetland. Even though the Norwegian government recognizes the importance of protecting wetlands to prevent greenhouse gas
emissions, preservation of natural habitats and biodiversity, draining of wetlands for economic gain is still an option for Norwegian farmers. Due to few investigations of wetland sites in Norway, knowledge on the preservation of archaeological artefacts in
the various types of wetland areas is poor. This paper presents the preliminary results from a recent investigation at the Jortveit
farm, central Skagerrak Coast, south Norway. In 1931, the wetland area at Jortveit (35 ha) was drained by manual force, which
led to the discovery of fish and whalebones as well as osseous artefacts at 1.7 m depth. In 2018, a selection of artefacts from
Jortveit were AMS-dated to the 4th and 3rd mill. BC, and a small-scale investigation executed at the original find spot. The exceptional preservation conditions at Jortveit sheds new light on preservation conditions for organic artefacts in isolated soft-bottom bays in the Skagerrak area. Today, these are wetlands (incl. bogs) isolated from the sea as an effect of steady isostatic land
uplift throughout the Holocene. Such sites challenges the day-to-day CHM practices in Norway, i.e. development led surveying
and excavations.
