Presentation Format: Oral
Ancient Lake Duvensee in Northern Germany is one of the key regions for understanding early Mesolithic lifeways in Europe.
Being in focus of archaeological research for almost 100 years, the peat bog yields several well preserved settlement sites from
the Early and Middle Holocene and provided relevant insights into subsistence systems of Mesolithic people. But the area is not
only relevant from an archaeological perspective, also ornithological interests are well represented as it is a relevant stop for
migratory birds.
In this presentation we want to present how the archaeological research and preservation in Duvensee is handled and what
role the local community plays in this. After a short discussion of reasons for the extraordinary preservation of the sites, we
will discuss some implications for research at other sites and consequences for future preservation attempts. Also we want to
critically compare the sites from Duvensee with other, less well-preserved sites and deriving consequences for research.
