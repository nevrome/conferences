Presentation Format: Oral
During the seasons 2017-18 the University of Copenhagen have conducted field archaeology in the Åmosen bog, Zealand (Denmark), in order to examine the preservation of earlier famously excavated Mesolithic contexts. Methodologies where coring,
systematic field survey and test excavations are employed have been developed for the investigations. In general we see that
the bog has dried out due to drainage and modern agriculture, with severe consequences for the preservation of the Mesolithic
stratigraphies and for the organic artifact preservation. However, due to different environmental factors it has at few sites occasionally been possible to locate good preservation in the deepest Preboreal layers. In the paper the methodology applied, the
environmental factors, the archaeological status and the Mesolithic potential of the Åmosen bog is discussed. It is concluded
that we need to actively monitor and protect in situ mesolithic sites in wetlands if we are to preserve important information and
bio-archaeological evidence of our Mesolithic ancestors.
