The Ageröd peat bog site is one of the most famous Mesolithic settlements in Sweden. This is mostly due to the rich organic
finds recovered here on excavations in the 1940s and 1970s. However, the organic remains stored at Lund Historical Museum
show that the material excavated in the 1940s is in a better condition than the material from the 1970s. Furthermore, this pattern has also been observed to be a general occurrence on other archaeological sites. To elucidate what has happened with the
organic remains during the last 40 years we conducted a small trial excavation in Ageröd with the purpose of investigating the
organic deterioration at the site. Here we will present the results from this small trial excavation and link it to future possibilities
and plans to deepen our understanding of the deterioration and degradation of organic remains at the most vulnerable archaeological sites in Sweden; The Stone Age sites.
