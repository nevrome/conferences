HOME AND NATIVE LAND: DE-COLONISATION AND THE EARLIEST FRENCH SETTLEMENT IN CANADA (PORT-ROYAL NS)
Author(s): Godfrey, Evelyne (Uffington Heritage Watch)
Presentation Format: Oral
A full-scale historical reconstruction of the earliest permanent French colonial settlement in Canada, the 1605 Habitation at
Annapolis Port Royal in present-day Nova Scotia, began in 1939 and was completed in the early 1940s. Since then, the reconstructed fort complex at Port-Royal has been a registered National Historic Site, maintained by the Canadian Federal government
agency Parks Canada. The reconstruction was based on 17th century drawings and written accounts of the European colonists.
There were no standing remains on the site and the reconstruction was not based on archaeological excavation or survey to
locate the original settlement. The Indigenous side of the story was apparently largely silenced. The Port-Royal site is very much
in keeping with the ideology of the ‘Monument Movement’ projects that started in North America in the 1920s to late 1930s;
for example, Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, USA from 1927 onward, and Fort Henry in Kingston, Ontario, Canada from 1936. A
direct American influence can be discerned in the Canadian historical reconstruction sites, including the later project at Fortress
Louisbourg, Nova Scotia. The motivation at the time for creating these tourism venues arguably included establishing a ‘unified’
sense of the modern national identity via control of the historical narrative. This paper will briefly review the contemporary need
for archaeological and conservation work in the region of Port-Royal, and discuss how the historical narrative is currently being
conveyed at the site. Suggestions will be presented as to how progress can be made towards de-colonising the cultural heritage
landscape.
