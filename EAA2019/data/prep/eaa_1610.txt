LIVING ON THE WATER. THE PILE-DWELLING STRUCTURES BETWEEN HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND THE
ENVIRONMENT
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes

Format: Regular session
The structures of a settlement are always determined by the needs of a community and its strategies adaptive to the surrounding environment. This is particularly true for pile dwellings: wooden structures must adapt, often within the same settlement, to
different environmental situations, which often change over time. The session aims to focus on the theme of settlement structures in a wet environment, trying to take stock of what we know about the features of these settlements, of what kind of studies have been undertaken to define the relationships between technical solutions and the surrounding environment. The general
theme can be declined in different ways. Individual case studies can be presented, as well as regional frameworks or related to
a specific chronological context. Analyses concerning a single structural element can also be presented also with a diachronic
perspective. On the other hand, the theme can be tackled from the point of view of experimental archaeology and dealing with
exemplary cases of reconstruction of pile dwellings with ancient techniques. Studies of the geoarcheological approach, of sediment analysis underlying the raised structures and dendrotypological studies are welcome.
