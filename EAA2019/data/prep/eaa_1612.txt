The early Neolithic site of La Draga (Banyoles, Spain) is the only lake dwelling of Iberian Peninsula. The site is located at the
shore of Lake Banyoles (Northeast of Iberia) and has provided evidence of two occupation phases. The oldest phase has been
preserved in waterlogged conditions and has provided an important assemblage of wooden remains, among them more than one
thousand piles and other architectonical elements, while the second phase is characterized by stone pavements constructed
of travertine and the absence of wooden remains. According the c14 dating La Draga was occupied uninterruptedly between
5361-5223 and 5000-4796 cal BC. In this paper are presented the results of the dendrochronological analysis of the piles and
their relation with the phases of occupation identified according to the stratigraphy and radiocarbon dates. In addition, it is also
discussed the contribution of the dendrochronology for the characterization of the architecture of La Draga.
