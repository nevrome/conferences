The Neolithic lakeshore site Zug-Riedmatt was situated at lake Zug, in the delta of the river Lorze. It was settled between 32003100 cal BC and buried beneath 5 m of deltaic and limnic sediments, which led to an excellent preservation with organic deposits
of up to 1.3 m of thickness.
The site formation processes were reconstructed by analysing the same samples of one profile sequence (spanning the whole
occupation layer) by micromorphology, carpology, palynology, entomology and palynofacies analyses and combining the results
in a microarchaeological, multi-proxy, transdiciplinary approach. Through this approach, it was possible to gain an understanding
of the processes that led to the deposition of different sediments at the site and the factors that influenced them. The results
of the different disciplines often matched. Influences of the river, the lake as well as a pond situation could be distinguished in
varying degrees of intensity. Their complex interactions led to the deposit we find today and strongly influenced the life of the
inhabitant of the site in the past.
We will present the most important natural and anthropogenic factors that influenced the formation of the deposits of this
lakeshore settlement and show how the conditions at the site changed over time.
