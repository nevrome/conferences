Presentation Format: Oral
Anarghiri IXb is a prehistoric lakeside settlement with successive habitation layers dating from Late Neolithic I up to Early Bronze
Age (late 6th- mid 3rd mil. BC) located in a plain that until the 1960’s was the marshy northeastern shore of Lake Chimaditis in
Amindeon Basin. The rescue excavation of the site lasted from 2013- 2017 and covered 12.000m2 on the periphery of the settlement, as well as 8.000m2 in the central habitation zone.
Apart from the numerous movable finds representing various aspects of the socio-economic and ideological activities of the
Neolithic community, the dominant findings unearthed from the lowest anthropogenic layers were more than 3.500 wooden
structural elements of various types. These constituted one rather typical prehistoric pile-field, whose analysis has led to the
identification of some unique for Greek prehistory and quite early non-residential structures, namely three wooden trackways
and parts of the settlement’s enclosing works (fences). Their architectural form, their correlation to the neighboring activity areas and their possible function(s) at the margins of the occupation’s main residential zone and beyond, are some of the issues to
be discussed. Furthermore, some general conclusions regarding the settlement’s layout will be drawn, together with the limitations to the interpretative approaches posed by stratigraphic complexities, discontinuities in spatial distribution of the material
and depositional/post-depositional layers’ formation processes detected in the archaeological record of Anarghiri IXb.
