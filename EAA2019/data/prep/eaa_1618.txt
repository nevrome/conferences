PILE-DWELLING

Presentation Format: Oral
The stratified deposits of Lavagnone, one of the few long term pile dwelling settlements of the Garda region, constitute an archive that documents an interrupted sequence, from the Early Bronze Age up to the Recent Bronze Age.
Stratigraphic digs brought to light nine settlement phases, that show transformations occurred in the same cultural tradition
(Polada culture in the Early Bronze Age, later on Palafitte and Terramare culture) and that can even be read in the light of men’s
relationship with the environment.
The excavation carried out in sector D involves a portion of the pile-dwelling settled during the Middle Bronze Age, of which remain some wooden vertical posts and, among them, the layers rich in cultural materials.
