To understand the function of the structures, explored over a very small area, are to be queried the data obtainable from the
archaeological deposits to which they are associated.
A multidisciplinary study has been undertaken, integrating studies over the cultural finds, the paleoenvironmental indicators,
the faunal remains and dendrochronology. From the point of view of the deposit formation, thin sections for micromorphological
studies were produced from undisturbed and oriented blocks. The aim was to reconstruct the accumulation of waste in heaps. A
specific focus was on the remains of the firing structures and their byproducts (I.e., different ash forms).
The results can be compared and evaluated on a long-term diachronic perspective, as the context supports.
