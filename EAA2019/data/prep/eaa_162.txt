SHARED CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE NETHERLANDS. A SHARED HISTORY, A SHARED FUTURE
Author(s): Joosten, Ineke (Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands)
Presentation Format: Oral
How does the history of the Netherlands continue to influence Dutch society and our international relations? The language we
speak, the food we eat, the buildings that surround us and the stories we pass on bear many traces of a shared history with other
countries, among them Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Suriname, Sri Lanka, the United States and South Africa.
The Netherlands is now working with these countries to preserve the significance of these historical links for future generations.
The Shared Cultural Heritage programme is part of the Netherlands’ international cultural policy. For the 2017-2020 period, the
Dutch Ministries of Foreign A airs and of Education, Culture and Science have formulated a policy for this programme that focuses on ten partner countries: Suriname, Brazil, the United States, Russia, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Japan and
Australia. The programme operates on three basic premises:
•
Cooperation based on equality, reciprocity and respect for ownership is at the core of our commitment to our shared
cultural heritage.
•
International cooperation is needed if we are to preserve and manage this shared cultural heritage and make it accessible.
•
The participation of the public is essential for the sustainable development and repurposing of cultural heritage.
Within the Shared Cultural Heritage Programme, the Cultural Heritage Agency supports local experts in partner countries by
promoting the exchange of knowledge and capacity building. The instruments that the Agency uses are training, advice and
knowledge products such as handbooks and inventories.
