HOUSE FLOORS AND SETTLEMENT CHRONOLOGIES: EVIDENCE FROM WETLANDS AND BEYOND FOR
IRON AGE ROUNDHOUSES IN SCOTLAND

Presentation Format: Oral
This paper considers the results of two excavations of well preserved Iron Age roundhouse settlements in Scotland, UK carried
out in recent years. At the Black Loch of Myrton, a series of well-preserved wooden roundhouses have provided sequences of
superimposed floors and hearths that have yielded a diverse range of information sources on how the buildings were used and
refurbished. A remarkably similar scenario has recently been encountered in a dryland context within the collapsed broch tower
at Clachtoll on the north west mainland, recently the subject of conservation-led excavations. At this site, at least three phases
of hearth construction accompanied frequent refurbishment of the house floor, with some evidence present for the differentiation of activity areas within the building. Specialist analysis of microstratigraphy, evidence from palaeoecological and chemical
proxies from as well as dendrochronology from these well preserved floor layers and their associated structures have led to a far
more nuanced understanding of the nature and duration of roundhouse occupation in the later first millennium BC. This paper will
compare and contrast the evidence from the wetland settlement at Black Loch with the dryland situation at Clachtoll, discuss
how far such comparisons can be extrapolated to explain patterns in the wider settlement record of the Scottish Iron Age and
consider the implications for our understanding of the function of roundhouses more generally.
