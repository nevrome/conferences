PROPOSAL FOR A SHARED DATABASE FOR HORIZONTAL WOODEN ELEMENTS FROM PILE-DWELLING
VILLAGES
Author(s): Martinelli, Nicoletta (Laboratorio Dendrodata)
Presentation Format: Oral
The most striking and well-known image of a pile-dwelling site is the so-called “field of posts”, originated by the preservation of
the lower part of thousands vertical posts stuck into the ground for dozens of years or even for centuries, in order to bear the
roof or the raised floor of the houses, or the pathways, or to create palisades or other kinds of structure.
On the contrary, the number of woods coming from the upper parts of the buildings is very low. The recovery of these elements
rarely occurs in the form of “horizontal woods” felled down in case of destruction or fire. Despite their great importance for the
identification of building techniques and the reconstruction of the houses, these finds are scarcely published in an adequate
way: very often their presence is only quoted in the text, more frequently some photos are presented, but very seldom their
drawings and their measures are published, like they would deserve. That way when new discoveries happen, the archaeologist
have to become as imaginative as possible to identify their possible use, in the absence of adequate items for comparison.
For overcoming the obstacle a common shared data-base to be filled by every archaeologist involved in pile-dwelling research
would be needed. In the presentation all the characters and documents related to horizonthal woods necessary for the purpose
will be illustrated. A proposal for a twin database dedicated to the known elements of traditional architecture in wood will be
illustrated as well and further suggestions from the audience will be well-accepted.
