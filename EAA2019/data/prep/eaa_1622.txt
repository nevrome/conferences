Presentation Format: Oral
The site of the Laghetto della Costa is a perispondal pile-dwelling settlement, located on the south-western sector of the homonymous thermal lake, in the municipality of Arqu√† Petrarca (PD).
The site consists of an archaeological area distributed over a large surface along the southern and western shore of the lake
basin.
Over the years, numerous excavations and discoveries identified several settlement zones along the perimeter of the lake, especially in the south-eastern shores: between 1885 and 1886 the first excavation were carried out by Federico Cordenons on
behalf of the Civic Museums of Padua and National Museum of Este; in 1901 the excavations took place with Andrea Moschetti
and Cordenons; in 1906 other excavations were carried out by Alfonso Alfonsi and Gherardo Ghirardini in the area southwest of
the lake; finally, in 1909, an excavation campaign was conducted by Cordenons for the University of Padua.
The materials recovered, mainly ceramics, bone and antler artifacts and stone industry, testify the long duration of the settlements.
