From the re-elaboration of data from the old excavations it was found that part of the settlement was made up of buildings on
raised floor, while another part was set up on land reclamation structures built directly on the ground. The latter are described
as ”decks” of large oak beams, placed side by side and fixed by small vertical poles, constipated with branches of various sizes
and large stones. The radiocarbon dating carried out on one of the small pole kept at the Museum of Padua allowed to date the
construction between 2133 and 1983 cal BC.
New surveys and coring campaigns carried out in 2015 confirm the location of the old excavations, positioned with georeferencing.
The contribution aims to provide an updated reading of the known and unpublished data on the structures of the settlement.
