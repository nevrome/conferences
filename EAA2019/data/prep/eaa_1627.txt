data, and the broader discipline because todayâ€™s research and public engagement shape the future potential of archaeological investigations. Likewise, all archaeologists must consider the role of engagement alongside the eventual dissemination of knowledge, not just data, to a general, public audience, via diverse media. Consequently, our interaction with the public must adapt to
changes in the social context of archaeology, demonstrating to the public what archaeology is, why archaeology matters, and in
doing so, defining legitimate, scientific archaeology from sensationalized pseudoscience. This session explores strategies that
contextualize archaeological engagement by addressing these issues and drawing on case studies demonstrating critical and
creative approaches to high-quality research, instruction, and engagement. Contributions will address methodologies employed
in various disciplinary contexts, utilizing case studies to demonstrate solutions that engage and inform the public while maintaining rigorous professional standards.
