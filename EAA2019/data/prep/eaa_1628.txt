Author(s): Balco, William (University of North Georgia)
Presentation Format: Oral
Recent archaeological investigation at the Rice Farm site in Dawson County, Georgia, have identified and examined a Native
American settlement dating from the Middle Woodland period (approximately 300 BCE â€“ 600 CE). Exploration of the site has incorporated university students alongside members of the local community, engaging the public in the process of archaeological
investigation through geophysical survey, pedestrian survey, test excavations, and initial interpretation. This paper presents
public engagement strategies employed at the site, focusing on approaches that educate and inform while maintaining rigorous standards and contributing positively to understanding the archaeological record. Strategies that directly incorporate the
participation of the public and shape their perception of archaeological investigation will be discussed, demonstrating the value
of education through engagement in shaping public knowledge about the importance of heritage management, the scientific
study of the past, and the preservation of archaeological sites. Finally, the benefits and challenges associated with educational
engagement will be presented, creating a framework for meaningful community engagement in the 21st century.
