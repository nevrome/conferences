MAKING ARCHAEOLOGY MATTER – TELLING SCOTLAND’S STORY
Author(s): Jones, Rebecca - Owen, Kirsty (HES Historic Environment Scotland)
Presentation Format: Oral
Scotland has a strategy for archaeology, launched at the EAA in 2015, which aims to improve the way in which archaeology is
practiced and make it matter. Why should it matter? What is the purpose of public engagement? Where is the public benefit? We
recognise that we have a responsibility to use archaeological activities for wider public benefit, and this means getting better
at communicating the results of research. We can use archaeology to tell stories of the past, not just for their own sake but also
consider their contemporary relevance, contributing to climate change, the promotion of diversity, the construction of sustainable communities and the appreciation and understanding of place.
As a national lead body, Historic Environment Scotland is seeking to bridge the gap between people’s day-to-day lives and archaeology, making it clearer why it is important to everyone. We undertake archaeological fieldwork and research and also fund
others. Through better, more relevant, stories and imagery, we can convey the information that we are all gathering in such a way
as to increase public interest and benefit and, ultimately, make archaeology matter.
