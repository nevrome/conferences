Presentation Format: Oral
Four years after the reform of the Ministry of Heritage and Cultural Activities, which marked the birth of state museums in Italy
with special autonomy, the Royal Museums of Turin (MRT) propose an evaluation of the results in relation to one of the museumâ€™s
souls: the archeology.
Since 2015, the MRT have brought together different museums: the Royal Palace, the Royal Armory, the Royal Library, the Sabauda Gallery, and the Museum of Antiquities. The first objective was to create a common identity and to bring together different
collections, people and disciplinary fields. This has also meant to recreate the threads of the Savoy collections, enhancing the
common substratum of origin of the collections and creating work and research platforms shared by archaeologists, architects
and art historians. For the Museum of Antiquities, a museum that in the last decades has greatly strengthened its territorial
vocation, linked above all to excavation archeology, has been to bring to light the value of the oldest museum nucleuses, linked
to the collecting of the Savoy and local erudition, and centered on the great Mediterranean Civilizations.
The design and research choices have had to face a twofold objective: on the one hand to maintain firmly the vocation of archeology linked to the territory of belonging (and in some way to the Public Archeology) that the museum had built in the last
thirty years. ; on the other, bring to light the other soul of the museum linked to collecting, the birth of European museums and
antiquarian history.
