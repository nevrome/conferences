Applications for X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry as an analytical tool in archaeologically- and anthropologically-related disciplines continue to expand. Museum staff are charged with the amazing, yet daunting, task of housing, preserving, researching,
and showcasing our most valued cultural treasures, and this versatile tool can help. As a non-destructive technique for investigating elemental-based aspects of material culture, handheld XRFs are an effective analytical option for museum collections.
Are artifacts in your museum or institution poisonous? Cultural and archaeological artifacts were routinely treated with pesticides to prevent infestations. This problem has been known for decades. However, many museum professionals still lack awareness about this potential hazard. Institutions have been slow to carry out testing of artifacts. Handling of contaminated collections puts museum staff, volunteers, and visitors at risk. Exposure to toxins as a matter of course for museum staff and outside
curators can be minimized if an analysis is conducted on individual items and collections. Using a handheld XRF, it is possible to
test for the presence of heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead associated with pesticides and elemental composition
of pigments. In this presentation I use real life examples to demonstrate how to identify potentially contaminated artifacts, test
for pesticides, and provide guidelines on safe storage and handling.
