ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND HERITAGE MANAGERS: THE MISSING LINK WITH THE PUBLIC?
Author(s): Bedin, Edoardo (Arheološki muzej u Zagrebu; National Trust for Scotland)
Presentation Format: Oral
In the eye of a modern visitor an archaeologist is seen as the scholar who investigates an ancient site and his/her primary objective is knowledge advancement to be shared amongst the academic community, however the visitor is not expecting from
an archaeologist to actively engage with the general public and promote in an appealing fashion what he or she does for a living.
However, quite a lot changed in the late 1990s when Time Team TV-show was aired in United Kingdom and Ulisse-il Piacere della
Scoperta in Italy. These cultural TV-show offered a new insight to archaeology and more in general to heritage while archaeologists and heritage managers were “offered” the opportunity to open a dialogue with the general public. Since then archaeological
field-schools and commercial excavations have become site attractions and heritage sites (museums and sites) had to develop
a memorable ”experience” as more and more people visited those expecting to receive up-to-date information on the on-going
research. Public archaeology became embedded with archaeology and increasingly more often archaeological excavations offer
tours of the sites, while heritage sites (museums and archaeological sites with no on-going excavations) have begun a massive
up-date of their communication models. The emphasis is now on offering a scientific yet memorable experience.
This paper will concisely present in the first part the impact of cultural TV-show on the general audience and then introduce
the case study of University of Reading field-school: Silchester Insula IX and Insula III and its public engagement strategy. The
measure of success can be here highlighted by the site visitor figures: in 1997 just over one hundred visitors came to see the
excavations versus an astonishing 4,500+ in only 36 days.
