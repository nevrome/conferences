Format: Regular session
This session aims to host presentations on one of the most crucial and intricate transitions in human history, from the late
Acheulean to the early Middle Stone Age/ early Middle Palaeolithic. The combined approach on Africa and Eurasia offers the opportunity to overcome barriers caused by regional research traditions and compare views on hominin evolutionary trajectories
and the nature of cultural change.
In Africa, the archaeological record indicates the coexistence of populations with different techno-behaviors; some are a continuation of Acheulean traditions until 200ka while others show an early development of MSA technologies before 300ka. The approach on transitional assemblages is difficult to standardize, and their interpretation is subject to a wide range of hypotheses,
in which the biological transition from Homo erectus to the first representatives of Homo sapiens may also play a role. However,
in Eurasia, different biological transformations are ongoing, and it is of particular interest to evaluate similarities and differences
in the changes in material culture, in particular in view of the sub-contemporaneous development of prepared core technologies,
flake, point or blade productions as main lithic strategies with regional variations in Africa and Eurasia by the end of the Acheu-
