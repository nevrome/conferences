The Acheulian site of Amanzi Springs, first excavated by Ray Inskeep and Hilary Deacon in the 1960s, has featured prominently in syntheses of the Earlier Stone Age in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The unique depositional context and
ground-water chemistry at Amanzi Springs have resulted in the preservation of wood and other botanical remains in association
with stratified artefact accumulations. Originally assigned to the late Acheulian based on artefact typology, the lack of an absolute chronology for Amanzi Springs has in the past limited its potential contribution to our understanding of spatial and temporal
patterns of hominin occupation and technological organisation in this region during the Middle Pleistocene. Here we report on
recent excavations at a newly discovered spring site at Amanzi Springs, referred to as Area 7, that contains a stratified sequence
of Earlier to Middle Stone Age artefacts, associated with preserved wood and macrofossil remains. Changing patterns of raw
material procurement and use, the introduction of prepared core technology and a shift in reduction strategies away from large
cutting tools towards the production of flakes, blades and points throughout the sequence at Area 7 provides an insight into the
processes of change from the Earlier to Middle Stone Age in this region. Continuing work at this new locality at Amanzi Springs
aims to develop a robust, high-resolution chronology, in order to examine technological change in an open-air context during a
time period that is not well documented in South Africa.
