Presentation Format: Oral
Access to resources and social networks spanning wide geographic areas is one behavioural feature commonly considered characteristic of modern humans. Provenancing of lithic raw materials makes it possible to trace movements across the prehistoric
landscape and can potentially be used to address larger questions such as the emergence of migration routes or trade. Previous
work in the under-researched Kalahari region has shown that partially prepared blocks of silcrete, the most common lithic raw
material, could be geochemically provenanced to source areas more than 250km away. This contribution will present new results
from recent excavations of open-air locales in the nearby Makgadikgadi Basin, where movement of raw material blocks can be
traced across multiple Middle Stone Age sites and silcrete outcrops. Refitting shows that lithic material was imported to and
exported from these sites at distinct chaîne opératoire stages, and that cores would likely be worked at multiple sites. It will be
argued that transport of lithic raw materials a) should be seen as an integrated part of tool production and b) varied with differences in landscapes and raw material availability. The resulting mobiliary patterns may be key to understanding Middle Stone
Age adaptation to resource rich and resource poor geographic areas. The presentation originates in an ongoing interdisciplinary
project focused on mobility and landscape use in a hydrologically dynamic region.
