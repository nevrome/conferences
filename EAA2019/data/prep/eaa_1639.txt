The lithic industry is typical for a knapping site dedicated to the production of bifaces and shows a Levallois-type production of
large flakes. Preliminary OSL dates place this industry within late OIS 7, a period during which the MSA is already largely developed
in some other parts of Africa. Here, we will present different scenarios discussing the late persistence of the Acheulean in this
region. This discussion takes into account data such as the absence of known early MSA sites in West Africa and the recent identification, by other teams, of a late persistence of MSA traditions in Senegal, as well as data regarding the few other occurrences
of very recent Acheulean sites in different parts of Africa. The ESA to MSA transition, as elsewhere, seems to show contrasted
cultural trajectories that may echo intricate occupational patterns in West Africa.
