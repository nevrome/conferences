the topic during the last few years and use the restitution of a few selected objects to improve their visibility and gain positive
publicity. De- colonisation itself is seen by museums and cultural heritage institutions both as ‘opening Pandora’s box’ (as in the
case of recent restitutions by E. Macron, France), or as an overdue act. At least in public, topics as ideal conservation, exhibition,
or accessibility of the objects to the local public seem to be less important.
Some countries, as Germany, are putting significant sums behind restitution research into objects from colonial contexts. Being
today (late enough!) only at the beginning of the process of restitution of objects from colonial context, or expatriated during
colonial times, it is even more important to find strategies to guarantee both visibility, accessibility, and conservation of the
objects concerned.
This presentation aims to give an overview on current politics and strategies of de-colonisation.
