VIEW FROM ARABIA

Most research on the Lower to Middle Palaeolithic transition has been conducted in a few small areas of Africa and Eurasia. A
clear understanding of this transition – such as identifying areas of population continuity in contrast to areas with occupational
hiatuses – requires spatially and temporally representative study sites. The 3.2 million square kilometres of Arabia have long
been known to have an abundant archaeological record, but it is only recently that scientific analyses such as chronometric
dating have begun to be applied. Here I present recent findings from Arabia, particularly from the An Nefud desert in the north. In
northern Arabia, the youngest dated Acheulean assemblage dates to MIS 9, and includes very small bifaces and a prepared core
element. The oldest Middle Palaeolithic, meanwhile currently dates to MIS 7. Recent fieldwork offers significant new insights
into both of these aspects. I explore different scenarios for the transition between these cultural phases, as well as situating
the evidence within wider patterns of human prehistory and adaptation in Arabia as a whole. I hypothesise that the Arabian record demonstrates repeated hominin dispersals into the area, followed by localised cultural developments and repeated local
extinctions.
