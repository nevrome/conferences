THE MIS 7-6 ACHEULEAN IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA

The Arabian Peninsula is situated at the nexus of the Old World, between Africa and Eurasia. Although long thought to have
been a barren and unoccupied area throughout deep time, abundant Achuelean assemblages have been reported throughout the
region. These assemblages are highly varied and typically found associated with river valleys and palaeolakes. Assemblage variation ranges from simply-flaked handaxes thought to represent older Acheulean assemblages, to small, finely flaked examples
sometimes associated with Levallois technology and considered to be more recent - perhaps even representing the transition
to the Middle Palaeolithic. Until recently, however, none of these Acheulean sites had been reliably dated. In this paper, the first
securely dated Acheulean site in Arabia, Saffaqah, is discussed, together with a newly studied Achuelean site named An Nasim.
Saffaqah is located in central Saudi Arabia and is associated with a prominent rhyolite dyke. The simple technology at this site
is belied by the very young dates obtained, which are likely to span into MIS 6 and overlap with the earliest Middle Palaeolithic in
the region. The site of An Nasim is located in the northern Nefud Desert and consists of fine, and often small handaxes associated with a deep lake. New dates and technological studies from An Nasim are discussed together with those from Saffaqah to
elucidate cultural process of change from the Acheulean to the Middle Palaeolithic in a key, but poorly understood region for the
Acheulean.
