Always found in stratigraphic position above the Acheulo-Yabrudian, the Early Middle Paleolithic (EMP) assemblages exhibit an
entirely different set of lithic production systems as well as tool types. Besides the total disappearance of the bifaces from the
tool-kit, the onset of the EMP is characterized by systematic use of the Levallois method, the proliferation of elongated blanks
generally produced through Levallois and Laminar methods and dominance of retouched points in the tool-kits. The presence
of a significant Levallois component including flakes, blades and Levallois points is documented from the beginning of the EMP
sequence. The points (retouched and Levallois) are a new component in the tool kit not recorded in the late Lower Paleolithic.
A clear technological break is thus evidenced between the Acheulo-Yabrudian and the Early Middle Paleolithic. This break needs
to be interpreted in terms of social or biological changes (i.e. demographic shifts, increase of population densities, changes in
mobility patterns). The expansion and diversification of the Levallois system at the onset of Middle Paleolithic raises the question of its origin. The possible arrival of exogenous population and/or of new ideas as suggested by the recent discoveries of AMH
remains in Misliya cave, associated with EMP circa 185 ka, will be discussed based on comparisons with East African assemblages earlier than 250ka. In addition, the chronological variability of the EMP, which lasted from circa 250 to 150 ka, and eventual
disappearance of the main EMP lithic characteristics circa 150 ka will be addressed.
