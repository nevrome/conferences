In assessments of stone tool assemblages of Eastern Asia, paleoanthropologists have frequently held that there are long periods of technological stasis, with no significant innovations until the second part of the Late Pleistocene. This view has been
sustained for the Nihewan Basin, which contains the densest concentration of early Pleistocene Paleolithic sites outside Africa.
However, a lack a detailed knowledge about Mid-Pleistocene lithic assemblages in the region hinders the establishment of time
trends in the area.
The Yuxian basin, which preserves archaeological remains in fluvio-lacustrine deposits, is located in the southeastern part of the
Nihewan basin, and since 2015 we have conducted systematic investigations of the area. The newly discovered Jijiazhuang-Qianshangying site complex (JJZ-QSY) has been excavated over an extension of 200 m2, and >2000 stone artifacts and abundant
fossils have been recovered. Biostratigraphy, OSL, ESR, as well as 26Al/10Be dating indicate that early hominin occupied the area
most between the mid to late Middle Pleistocene.
Sedimentological and taphonomic proxies suggest that the JJZ-B archaeological deposits were buried rapidly in shallow lake
margin deposits of fine sands and silts that were minimally disturbed and subjected only to relatively low energy sheet wash.
