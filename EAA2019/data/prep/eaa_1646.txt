Lithic raw materials were procured ca. 6 km away from the site complex, with volcanic lava dominating the rock types, and siliceous dolomite and chert appearing less commonly. Flaking techniques are dominated by direct hard hammer percussion, although many small flake butts display a lip that suggests soft hammer flaking was probably used as well. The JJZ-QSY lithic
assemblage shows a relatively advanced technology compared to the Mode 1 industries of the Early Pleistocene assemblages
in the Nihewan basin. Overall, the study of the JJZ-QSY site complex bears great potential on the research of human adaptive
behavior and technological trends in the Nihewan basin during the Middle Pleistocene.
