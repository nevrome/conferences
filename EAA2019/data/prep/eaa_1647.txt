Regarding the Palaeolithic lithic technology of China, one opinion holds that Mode 1 technology characterizing by simple cores
and flakes persists for most of the Pleistocene. Using new archaeological findings and research achievements, this presentation shows a brief summary of lithic technologies existing in China during the transitional period from Middle to Late Pleistocene.
Results show that during this time period lithic technologies in China exhibit clear diversity and complexity. Various technological
complexes occur. These include: an Acheulean techno-complex characterized by large cutting tools, such as handaxes, picks
and cleavers; a small flake tool techno-complex that features discrete tool types, refined retouch on blanks, and an increase
in discoidal core flaking; and a techno-complex characterized by scrapers with Quina-like retouch. Different techno-complexes
likely indicate that human groups possessed different cultural traditions. This provides a new perspective to discuss human
behavioural adaptation to various environments and inter-regional dispersals and contact among different population groups.
