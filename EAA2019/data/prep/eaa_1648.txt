THE CONSERVATION ARCHAEOLOGY OF DRY STONE MONUMENTS
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Cavers, Graeme - Barber, John (AOC Archaeology Group) - Cousseau, Florian (l’Université de Genève)
Format: Regular session
The conservation of dry-stone monuments presents a unique challenge: often, structures such as brochs, chambered tombs
and other megalithic monuments are complex in architectural and engineering terms, meaning that a thorough understanding of
the principles of their construction is necessary before they can be stabilised. The patterns of their collapse and decay can be
similarly complex, often leaving fragile remains of corbelled cells, stair chambers and lintelled passages that can be a hazard to
both archaeological deposits and the visiting public.
Equally important is the need to design an approach to conservation that preserves the important characteristics of the monument in such a way that visitors can understand the original form of the structure. Past approaches to drystone monument
conservation have too often sacrificed the visibility and authenticity of original features for the purposes of practical simplicity.
A related issue is the extent to which archaeological investigation and documentation should be considered an obligation of
practitioners undertaking intrusive conservation works, and whether such works should always be designed hand-in-hand with
research questions.
This session will aim to explore the relationship between conservation works and archaeological research and consider the variety of approaches to the challenges outlined above taken across Europe. Papers are invited that consider:
•
Conservation approaches and archaeological research design
•
Use of new technology in conservation archaeology
•
Conservation and presentation of archaeological interpretation.
