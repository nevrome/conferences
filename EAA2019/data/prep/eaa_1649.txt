OF PREHISTORIC DRY-STONE MONUMENTS IN SCOTLAND

Presentation Format: Oral
The structural consolidation and conservation of complex drystone monuments, such as the Neolithic chambered tombs and
Iron Age brochs of Scotland presents unique challenges but also unique opportunities. Such monuments tend to be fragile, typically surviving in only fragmentary form with the essential structural components compromised by various combinations of
collapse, stone robbing, erosion and, in some cases, ill-advised conservation. The carefully considered preservation of unstable
structures in Scotland is essential to the heritage management of an internationally-important resource, ensuring their survival for future generations, but also presents an opportunity for greater understanding of the design concepts, construction
techniques and original motivations for the erection of such architecturally challenging buildings. This paper will present recent
experiences in the conservation of Scottish brochs and chambered tombs, and consider how understanding the principles of
their construction is essential to the sensitive and appropriate stabilisation of their remnants, and to the preservation of their
archaeological legibility.
