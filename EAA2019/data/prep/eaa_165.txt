CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING AND THE RECOVERY OF HISTORIES IN POST-COLONIAL TIMES: AN ARGUMENT FOR EPISTEMOLOGICAL DECOLONISATION FROM SOAS, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON

Presentation Format: Oral
The discourse of decolonisation has become increasingly salient in British and European Universities, but how decolonisation is
to be understood is a question that each institution, discipline and scholar must explore from their unique location in global geography and history. At SOAS the debate has been equally diverse with an emphasis being placed on decolonising the curriculum,
diversifying taught syllabi and improving pedagogies to engage more interactively and substantively with minority students.
Research students, acting through the platform of the SOAS Journal of Postgraduate Research (SJPR), have recently placed
emphasis on decentring western epistemologies. As a previous editor-in-chief of SJPR, I will focus my presentation on epistemological decolonisation, which may be understood as a deeper reflection into the historical mechanisms of knowledge-making and
its colonial and ethnocentric underpinnings. It is imperative to recognise that knowledge, as well as the standards that determine what makes valid knowledge, have been disproportionately informed by western systems of thought and ways of reflecting
about the world. Promoting cross-cultural understanding and recovering global histories, which precisely falls within the remit
of archaeological and culture studies, requires both reflexivity on epistemological hierarchies and willingness to understand the
world through the belief and knowledge systems, lived experiences and aetiologies of the local insiders.
