AUTHENTICITY IN RESTORING A MEGALITH IN NORTHWEST FRANCE: THE EXAMPLE OF THE CARN
TUMULUS AT PLOUDALMEZEAU (FINISTÈRE)

Presentation Format: Oral
The tumulus of Carn, situated on the northern coast of Brittany, was simultaneously excavated and restored by P.-R. Giot in the
1960’s. At the end of the excavation, the specialised company which was responsible for the restoration of the Barnenez tumulus, did a massive campaign according to P.-R. Giot’s interpretation.
Our updated data from Carn, through its conserved masonries and excavation archives, permitted us to recognize P.-R. Giot’s approaches of visibility and authenticity for its restoration. This example reveals the context and way of thinking about megaliths
valorisation during the second half of the 20th century. Such restorations allowed archaeologists to build only one restitution of
the monument that could impact the modern interpretation and preservation of megaliths.
3D modelling has also been used for the study of the Carn tumulus. These new tools increase the possibilities for architecture
presentation and restitution. Using these methods, we drew new images for the Carn tumulus, which took more into account the
different hypotheses for its biography. This digitisation of megaliths will allow us to redefine the approach of their restoration,
preservation and authenticity related to their public presentation.
