Rock reliefs are mostly built in natural untouched environments. There is a great connection between the art work and the land
shape and vegetation around it. Naqsh-e Rustam rock-cut architectural heritage accompanied with bas-reliefs, located in Marvdasht county (Fars province of Iran), is an example of such heritage context. There, the rock formation is not only a source for
artistic inspiration but had also regarded as the shelter for very old human settlements according to the presence of relevant
cultural materials, i.e. traces of a rock relief belonging to Elamite period (c. 2000 BC). The continuity of rock cutting tradition and
the use of old transportation system has caused the long-term settlements of people in the vicinity of the sites, which shaped
rural structures in the borders of the landscape as a matter of fact. Up to now the conservation activities in these sites focuses
on the rock reliefs especially with regard to use of preservative materials. This type of interventions not only may cause damage
to the authenticity of the site and its environment but also has led to the negligence of other important aspects of the site
(tangible and intangible) attested by archeological surveys. A more comprehensive methodology for preservation is suggested
in this paper to respect better the integrity of all cultural layers and their spatial and anthropologic relations. This new approach,
toward the cultural landscape, offers opportunities to better integrate natural and cultural heritage conservation. Therefore, the
complexity of the territory and all the relevant cultural entities, tangible or intangible, were specially regarded within the framework of conservation management system.
