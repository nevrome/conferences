The sophisticated drystone Iron-Age brochs of Northern Scotland, called Complex Atlantic Roundhouses by archaeologists,
show a relatively high technological culture. Their architectural conservation should strike a balance in presenting their key features (structure, materials, building types, architectural elements) in a concept of wholeness rather than design unity. There is
however uncertainty due to the lack of agreement for a standard broch scheme and the need for more archaeological research.
However, possible hidden architectural links can be made between the elements, like staircases, entrances, and center in broch,
through a statistic study of brochs’ plans and sections. The Scottish brochs, when read architecturally can show how choices are
made among the options for each element based on a model of a standard broch. In this work, brochs from different geographic
conditions are compared to conjecture the original design intentions and skills of the broch builders and highlight the importance
of these characteristics when conservation is framed into a standard model.
The readable integrity of these architectural features within a context of constant fabric modifications is then discussed. The
ruins cannot offer an architectural experience of the original design if each broch leaves a different impression to visitors which
may challenge often popular broch definitions. Public attraction and scientific excavations are both important for broch conservation, so a balance must be established between them. This paper wants to open the debate for the extent of architects’
approach to broch conservation, going beyond archaeological or temporary preservation of fragile features.
