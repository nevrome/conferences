BRONZE AGE IN SOUTHERN GERMANY

Presentation Format: Oral
Cultural phenomena of the Early Bronze Age (EBA) in southern Germany have long been considered as little stratified. Unlike the
entities of the Únětice culture in central Germany, the Wessex culture in southern Britain or El Argar, the groups of the so-called
Straubing culture is not known for its exuberant rich graves. The differences between poor and well-furnished burials of the danubian EBA, which the Straubing culture belongs to, is indeed obvious, but single very elaborate princely graves are still missing
and will be missing in the future. Also urban centres with a high level of social stratification and specialisation are unknown.
However, the implementation of new technologies and methods of studying human remains has given the opportunity to examine EBA burial sites of southern Germany in a different and more detailed way. The case studies presented in the paper will
concentrate on social and biological interactions reconstructed on the basis of the results of aDNA research, isotope analysis
and archaeological evidence. Thereby kinship and human mobility play an indispensable role to connect people, wealth and burial
practices. Inter alia, the paper will address the question about how wealth was generated and/or passed down to biological descendants and which members of the communities participated in this social system.
