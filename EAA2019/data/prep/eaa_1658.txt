Princes and kings should lead the highely stratified and highborn men leaded EBA society in Central Germany during the first
centuries of the second Millenum BC. But the Central German Aunjetitz society was only one part of the whole large Early Bronze
Age Aunjetitz-system in the contemporary Central Europe. In the southern Aunjetitz regions (Bohemia, Moravia, Lower-Austria,
Slowakia) we miss comparable rich male tumulus-inhumations completely. But we have identified almost equal rich female inhumations on common skeleton cemeteries in these regions. Based on the analyse of the rich Early Bronze Age Aunjetitz cemetery
in Mikulovice, Bohemia, I will discuss the different social system in this Early Bronze Age Aunjetitz nodal region compared to the
highly stratified EBA society in Central Germany. We should try to discuss an interpret how and why could behave two (or more)
different social (and political?) systems within the frame of only one clearly defined entity cold archaeological culture.
