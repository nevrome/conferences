WEALTH

In autumn 2017 detectorists found near the village of Prêles (Canton of Berne) an extraordinary object: a nearly life size bronze
hand, decorated with a golden bracelet. Together with the hand they unearthed a dagger and a human rib. The organic glue that
was used to fix the golden bracelet on the hand allowed a radiocarbon dating of the object in the 15th or 14th c. BC. An excavation
at the site provided the evidence that the hand came from the tomb of an adult male that was placed at the site of an older cairn.
Further findings proved the dating of the tomb in the middle bronze age.
The bronze hand is so far the oldest known anthropomorphic bronze sculpture in middle Europe, if not in the whole of Europe. It
raises many questions about it’s meaning, use and about its owner. Was the hand part of a statue of a god or an ancestor? Did it
serve as scepters or as a symbolic prothesis? Was it just an extravaganza? What seems to be clear is that the hand is a symbol
of power and it’s owner or heir a member of a (so far unknown) local elite.
The paper aims at presenting and discussing this extraordinary find in an international context.
