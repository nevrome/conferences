COPPER SMELTING ON THE BUCHBERG NEAR WIESING AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EARLY
BRONZE AGE IN NORTH TYROL
Author(s): Keil, Jessica (Institute of Archaeologies Innsbruck)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Buchberg near Wiesing, an isolated hill within the North Tyrolean Lower Inn Valley, was occupied extensively during the Early
Bronze Age and, on a smaller scale, during the Iron Age as shown by several excavations since the 1980s. The existence of three
section ramparts, the lack of distinct buildings and the proof of metallurgical activities raises the question whether the features
dating to the Bronze Age are to be interpreted as a fortification, a settlement, and/or an industrial area. Based on the current
state of research it can be assumed that the copper smelting workshop was indeed the key feature.
The presentation will focus on the Buchberg as one of the earliest places of copper smelting in North Tyrol. It is of particular
interest to examine the raw materials by scientific analyses in order to identify the exploited mining sites. Subsequently, the origins and distribution of both the raw materials and the produced copper as well as other finds associated with the metallurgical
processes like, for example, slag-tempered ceramics might indicate how the Buchberg relates to other Early Bronze Age sites in
North Tyrol. Thus it might be possible to understand the significance of the site on the Buchberg and the people there.
