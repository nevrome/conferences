First of all, the concept of “state” has to be understood in the context of world which already had states. We don´t need to discuss that societies in Central European Early Bronze Age (CEEBA) were not on the same level and were “invisible” to the rulers
of the Eastern Mediterranean. However, it could be fruitful to discuss how much developed and governed these societies of
our concern were. In this paper we would like to discuss three different regions with rather different settlement patterns which
consists of data with different information value from southwest Slovakia. The first region is upper Záhorie on the eastern bank
of Morava river. The components are rather diverse (hoards, graveyards, settlements of various types) but are scarce. However
there is one really huge settlement in Unín which likely “ruled them all”. The second region is Nitra river valley. Densely populated,
all components are present, including graveyards with hundreds of graves. The third region is Ipeľ river valley, densely populated
with Hatvan culture sites, which are actually mostly small fortified settlements. We shall explore if we could build three different
models of social organization from these data (while keeping in mind that each of these models evolved on their own in time).
What always concerned us however is that CEEBA is rarely compared to later periods of Middle and Late Bronze Age. We shall do
that as well. It is fashionable nowadays to construct great narratives again. But to get the bigger picture, we again need to look
at the processes that were involved, and that from longer and larger perspective.
