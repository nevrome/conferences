Several ‘rich’ graves have been found in the Low Countries, the Orkney Islands and in Schleswig-Holstein dating to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age (2500-1750 BC). These graves, because of their impressive grave goods, have often been interpreted as
belonging to elites. But they can also be seen from the perspective of varying degrees of access to the (‘Bell Beaker’ or ‘Únětice’)
networks of knowledge and information exchange and skill of ‘how things should be done’. The possibilities of acquiring special
objects within these networks and the changing rhythms and patterns in burial practices can be related to the amount of skill in
pottery production, to changing settlement practices and subsistence strategies. Also this provides a better account for the
distribution of copper, gold and stone artefacts. Can we then still speak of the buried individuals as elites during life or should we
consider these deceased from a different perspective?
