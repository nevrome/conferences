Applying the rather traditional method of constructing a wealth index based on grave goods and grave construction attributed to
an individual, the presented study tries to open a dialogue for a more open-minded discussion towards Bronze Age social organization. The presentation will focus on the Bronze Age ceramic style complexes of the Carpathian Basin during the first half of the
2nd Millennium and their consumption of material wealth in burial rites.
There is no rejection in the tendencies of increasing social stratification during the Bronze Age in Central European societies
which becomes visible especially in the treatment of the dead. However, it seems possible to trace finer nuances of social organization when one is widening not only the methodological but also theoretical framework concerning the possible forms of
social relations on intra- and intergroup levels. The vast spatio-chronological transformations in material culture during specific
periods of the Bronze Age not necessarily pictures conquest or economic exploitation of neighbors but might results through the
contact and exchange, not necessarily peaceful, between neighboring communities facing the same struggles.
I hope to show that communities which were often conceptualized as different might share specific economic and social traits
what makes the idea of cooperation between them more comprehensible. And instead of seeing two ‘opposing’ ceramic style
complexes different from each other in the expression of material culture see a bigger group which share a common system of
social and economic organization.
