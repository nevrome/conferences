Presentation Format: Oral
In recent years, based on intensive research, it has become clear that the peninsula of Istria was integrated into the broad Central European communication network during the developed Early and Middle Bronze Age. On the one hand, this is evidenced by
the finds of “Loaf-of-Bread Idols” and characteristic bronzes that came to light in the fortified settlement of Monkodonja, and on
the other hand by the fact that the Istrian ceramic spectrum shows clear relations to the Danube-Carpathian region. Particularly
noteworthy are elements from the ceramic repertoire of the Aunjetitz culture in Lower Austria with the Unterwölbing group and
the Böheimkirchner group of the Vĕteřov culture. For some vessels it can also be assumed that they are imports from the aforementioned region.
The research in the fortified hilltop settlement of Monkodonja has also shown that the settlement has pronounced hierarchical
structures. These include differences in the architecture of individual areas of the settlement and differences in the spectrum
of finds. Furthermore, there is evidence that centralized storage of large quantities of food, delivered from surrounding areas,
has been practiced. On the one hand, we want to discuss in our presentation the findings and finds that support these hierarchical structures, and on the other hand, we will stress out the relationship with the Central European communication network.
