Gold work was an important means of cultural and social expression and exchange during the Early Bronze Age, a period rich in
gold jewelry, decorative objects and also vessels. This paper deals with the development and change of the esthetic appearance
and social function of luxury items, such as gold ornaments and containers, and with their particular fine metal working technology. Along Atlantic Europe, ideas and peoples moved exchanging information, goods and technological knowhow by maritime and
terrestrial routes. The presentation aims in scrutinizing the development, change and interdependence of form, function and
technology of ancient gold work. Local interregional and trans-regional Atlantic groups of gold items will be highlighted. One other

society. The presentation also intends to emphasize the particular symbolic meaning and decoration of ornaments. The interdisciplinary approach applied in this study includes archaeology, ethnoarchaeology, experimental archaeology, material sciences
and information from ancient literary sources.
