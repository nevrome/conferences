This deals with issues of locating and characterising the source areas; of identifying the compositional and physical changes
that gold undergoes as it is worked, alloyed, mixed and recycled; of sourcing gold (including consideration of all the potential gold
source areas); of understanding how it was worked, what the influences on goldworking traditions were, and how goldworking
know-how was passed on; and of considering the value and significance of gold to its users in Britainâ€™s auriferous zones during
the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age. Gold and goldworking were Beaker introductions to Britain, but from around 2200 BC, Cornish
gold seems to have been used. We try to trace the pattern of raw material exploitation and of the changing provision and supply
of gold over 1500+ years.
