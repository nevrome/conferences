EUROPEAN BRONZE AGE

Presentation Format: Poster
The constitution of social stratification is based on contradictions within societies that trigger the restriction of access to resources. While manifold features of different medial display of EBA surplus in burial mounds, artefact designs and house sizes,
are usually interpreted as indication of social stratification, ethno-archaeological comparisons to EBA societies describe different possibilities of an interpretation. Beside stratified societies non-stratified societies existed contemporary to each other under similar economic, demographic and environmental conditions. In an attempt to identify different degrees of hierarchies and
balances in Early and Middle Bronze Age Societies of Central Europe a hypothetical spatial division will be presented: between
those areas, in which hierarchies are visible, and others, in which cooperative political constitutions were preferred.
The reproduction of social relations and especially the degree of social stratification seems to be based on the linkage of demography, economy and resource availability. The presentation integrates the results of our long lasting fieldwork in north eastern
Central Europe and recent reconstruction of population values for BA groups.
