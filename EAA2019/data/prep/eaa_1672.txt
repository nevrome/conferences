DISCUSSING THE VALUE AND PUBLIC UTILITY OF ARCHAEOLOGY
Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms
Organisers: Hanson, John (University of Reading) - Ortman, Scott (University of Colorado, Boulder)
Format: Regular session
Although archaeological research been spectacularly successful over the last fifty years, in many ways our perception of the
value and public utility of the archaeological endeavour, as a social science, has been diminished. This is surprising, since it directly contrasts with something social scientists have known for some time â€“ that the accumulation of socially learnt, culturally
transmitted knowledge plays an important role in allowing human societies to adapt to changing circumstances. In this session,
we would like to discuss the reasons for believing in the value and public utility of archaeology, taking time to reflect on the role
of synthesis, the prospects of general models of human behaviour, especially with respect to the interactions between the environment, resource use, and agglomeration, and the kind of voice archaeological research should have in wider society. In doing
so, we hope to make a case that archaeological research can and should make a crucial contribution to contemporary discourse.
