Scientific funding agencies have invested heavily in synthesis centers in the biological sciences. At their core, these centers
assume that collaborative synthetic research will advance scientific research more effectively and efficiently than traditional
case study approaches. On measures such publications, impact values, and citations, synthesis centers have been phenomenally successful. While some synthesis center projects have been used as the scientific basis on which public policies have been
based, the link between collaborative synthetic research and public benefit is not quite as clear.
Building on the model set by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), the Coalition for Archaeological
Synthesis (CfAS) was established in 2017. CfAS’ objective is to use collaborative, evidence-based synthetic research on deeptime social processes to advance science and benefit society. But how do we measure social benefit? And, as importantly, who
decides if a given scientifically-informed public policy represents a public “good”? These are difficult questions, but we cannot
shy away from them. In this paper, we discuss: how CfAS research questions emerge; how CfAS projects are designed; how we
intend to use CfAS results to better society; and how you can become involved in CfAS projects.
