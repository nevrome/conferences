WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED IN DANISH CONTRACT
ARCHAEOLOGY?

Presentation Format: Oral
The relevance of an excavation is often assessed on the basis of its contribution to archaeological knowledge, and an excavation that present new, sensational details about the past rarely needs further arguments. In Danish contract archaeology, the
potential for new knowledge is even used by the Cultural Heritage Agency as an evaluation tool to decide whether an excavation
should be conducted or not. However, there are no clear definitions of what ‘new archaeological knowledge’ is within the field.
This ambiguity is, as I see it, not only problematic in the management of the contract archaeology but also for the research and
communication of the results - and in the end, it spreads uncertainty about the contribution of archaeology in contemporary
society not only among the public, but also among archaeologists themselves. A discussion of what archaeological knowledge is
as seen from the engine room of contract archaeology is therefore needed.
In the paper, I will present some preliminary results from an investigation of archaeologists working in contract archaeology in
Denmark and their perceptions of archaeological knowledge. The results will be used to identify and discuss some of the challenges in making archaeological knowledge relevant to present-day life. The paper is based on a current research project (20192020) that explore the present conditions for knowledge production in Danish contract archaeology as an essential first step in
rethinking the connection between contract archaeology and contemporary society.
