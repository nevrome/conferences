CAN ANCIENT CITIES TELL US SOMETHING MODERN CITIES CANâ€™T?
Author(s): Hanson, John (John Hanson)
Presentation Format: Oral
Although there have been considerable advances in our ability to investigate various aspects of human life through the collection of massive amounts of data, it can still be a significant challenge to measure socio-economic flows, even in the modern
world, because of the wide range of channels through which these exchanges can occur. Having said this, it might be easier to
investigate these issues by looking at what happened in the past, since we would not only expect goods and information to have
been physically exchanged owing to lower levels of technological development, but also for these exchanges to have required
physical infrastructure that we should be able to measure quite readily from material remains. In this talk, I will begin by exploring
whether there are circumstances where archaeological and historical data give us the opportunity to develop theories in controlled settings or where these data might be just as good as, if not better than, modern data, before illustrating these issues
with a case-study in the form of transport infrastructure and the magnitude of traffic flows in ancient cities. In doing so, I will argue that it is possible to detect a systematic relationship between the sizes of cities and this material, allowing us to contribute
to a growing body of general theory about how settlements operate across space and time.
