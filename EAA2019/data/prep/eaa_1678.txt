by many authors as a proxy for household wealth. This has been a productive approach, but in many parts of the world houses
are hard to identify archaeologically, even with excavation, and this leads to severe problems with regard to the study of wealth
variation across time and space. In this paper, I suggest an additional useful proxy for studies of this kind is the accumulation
rate of potsherds. I examine the remarkable database compiled for the Rural Settlement of Roman Britain Project in light of an
emerging framework known as settlement scaling theory to show that the pottery accumulation rate and the coin loss rate both
co-vary with settlement population in a manner consistent with a socio-economic rate. This suggests simple measures that are
routinely available from the archaeological record, such as the kilograms of pottery per square meter of excavation per year of
occupation, can be used to study economic processes in many societies.
