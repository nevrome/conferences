the main focus of the mortuary activity in the past. The entire burial ground being interconnected, should be studied as part of a
system of rituals and beliefs. Most of the archaeological evidence gathered to date has indicated that the funerary rituals associated with newborn and sometimes older infants vary greatly compared to those afforded to older juveniles and adults. Perhaps
we should not be entirely surprised at this situation since contemporary authors from antiquity, for example, describe how the
death of a baby or young child could perhaps be considered in a different way.
Archaeologists generally consider the burials of juveniles in a different way to those of adults but they cannot be certain that
the proscribed rituals are structurally different to those of the remainder of society. As such, the crux of this session will be to
determine how we interpret the funerary rituals afforded to children of a variety of ages. Should they be considered as atypical,
deviant or normative within particular societies?
In this session we ask for original contributions regarding juvenile funerary rituals from all periods and geographical areas. We
ask contributors to not only focus on descriptions of the skeletons and burials but rather, we wish the main focus to be on interpretation and take an archaeothanatological and systemic approach, that contextualises the findings more broadly in relation to
the society in question. Using this approach, it is hoped that we can go beyond paradigms concerning juvenile funerary rituals.
