WORLD HERITAGE SITES

Presentation Format: Oral
ICOMOS (International Committee of Monuments and Sites) and ICAHM (International Scientific Committee on Archaeological
Heritage Management) play a major role in the nomination of experts for collaboration on archaeological UNESCO World Heritage
sites. Yet many archaeologists do not know what international experts do in this context.
First I would like to define the role of experts before, during and after World Heritage nominations and give an overview of the
structures in which they evolve.
Being an expert exposed to the management of World Heritage sites is not an easy task. It demands a knowledge of international
archaeological heritage management and intercultural competences, but also empathy, curiosity and critical good sense.
Therefore I propose to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the existing expertise system based on a large experience.
Resulting from this, I will propose a few leads to help improve the work of the experts and the existing structures.
