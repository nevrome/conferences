This paper will present the results of the Sense and Sustainability conference 6-10 May 2019 in Zagreb which will bring together
experts and practitioners from tourism and archaeological heritage management from all over the world. The conference’s focus
is the sustainable management and use of archaeology in heritage tourism. The conference, in which EAA and the EAA Community on Integrating the Management of Archaeological Heritage and Tourism are organising partners, is being hosted by the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. It is part of the Interreg Danube Transnational Programme 2014-2020 and is being partly financed by

The Conference is centered around four main themes:
