Presentation Format: Oral
Since 2016, the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation has been using various UAVs for the documentation of
archaeological excavations or archaeological monuments. This is mainly done by aerial photography. Encouraged by the cooperation with the UNESCO-certified GeoPark Harz, the UNESCO World Heritage Foundation Harz and ICOMOS (German section), the
State Office has begun to expand the criteria for monitoring especially medieval monuments. Since 2017, aspects developed in
environmental and nature conservation have been integrated, for example theuse of the process „Structure from Motion“. This
was initially tested at archaeological sites, but will also be used for architectural monuments.
A further aspect is the future linking of the monitoring of monuments (buildings) and archaeological sites in one work step. In
this paper, examples of the targeted combination of infrared images (IR), LIDAR-Scans and various archaeological prospection
methods will be presented and the possibilities of monitoring for large listed areas will be discussed.
