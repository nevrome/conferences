Pahlavi, last Shah of Iran, built a tent city to invite his royal guests for the celebration of 2500 years of Iranian monarchy in 1971.
The vestiges of these tents still exist and are situated in the core zone of the nominated property.
After 45 years, the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organisation (ICHTO) would like to renovate the structures and integrate
them into the master plan for the touristic development of the site. Many ideas have been mentioned, yet is not quite sure what
is allowed or not following UNESCO directives.
The following questions must find answers and we are persuaded that a discussion with archaeological heritage management
specialists may lead us to find appropriate solutions :
Is a reconstruction possible ? And if so, how can these tents be used ? Should they be used for an exhibition of arts and crafts,
a 3D dome cinema, as a place for public enhancement such as archaeological workshops for young people, or even as a luxury
hotel, much like the original use of most the tents ? Could this area also be the place for a much needed research centre, archive
and management office ?
This paper will address the opportunities, challenges and limits of developing a WH property nominated more than 40 years ago,
when UNESCO had other expectations. We will particularly stress the development of the use of the core zone.
