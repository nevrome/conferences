Presentation Format: Oral
The big number of fortifications like hillforts, strongholds, promontory forts or enclosures of different types in Europe as well
as the wide geographical, chronological and functional variety of the monuments led to different methodological approaches,
strategies and results of investigations of fortifications in the past.
Numerous excavations within several decades of archaeological research have provided various information about the occupation layers, functions and chronology of ramparts, walls and ditches as the main constructive elements of fortifications. Nevertheless, new information can be gained under the application of interdisciplinary methods. Such approaches provide new results
regarding the construction and stratigraphy of the monuments. In the introduction the organizers will highlight some of the main
questions about the investigation of fortifications and especially their defensive structures.
Problems, needs and challenges of fortification research will be discussed on the basis of a few, well studied monuments to
evaluate, which of the many investigation methods provide us with which particular information. The introduction develops a red
line for the session and supplies the participants with a theoretical background for the later discussion.
