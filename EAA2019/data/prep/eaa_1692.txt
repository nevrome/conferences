Prehistoric fortifications are generally associated with agricultural societies, while hunter-gatherers forts remain an underexplored field in archaeological and anthropological debates. In this context, the seven millennia deep history of fortified settlements in the Western Siberian taiga represents an outstanding phenomenon in world prehistory. After an initial emergence of
settlements fortified by ramparts, ditches and palisades in the 7th-6th millennium cal BC, further peaks with hundreds of defensive constructions occur in the Iron Age and in Early Modern times. Investigations of this phenomenon are still very limited, and
in-depth analyses of defensive structures, their functions and diachronic developments are lacking. Research into this complex
has the potential to open up a new facet in hunter-gatherer archaeology and also enhance the understanding of the rise and effects of intergroup conflict in acephalous, heterarchical societies. From an archaeological point of view, favourable preservation
conditions of surface features such as ramparts, ditches, gates and pit houses in the unploughed taiga forests as well as organic
preservation in the permafrost regions to the north lead to a particularily rich, accessible archaeological record on these fortified
sites. Of special relevance is ethnohistorical evidence from Russian sources as well as folklore of indigenous groups, providing
unique information on both the societal background of Siberian defensive structures and the connections between built structures and particular defensive strategies. The sources indicate that at least the historically documented defenses were often
protecting hunter-fisher communities from raids of herding nomads, both from the steppe and the tundra, and they also yield rich
information on defensive practices not generally thought of when interpreting archaeological structures, such as intentional
ice-covering of ramparts. In our talk, we will present first results from joint Russian-German research in Western Siberia devoted
to the diachronic study of defensive constructions based on archaeological and ethnoarchaeological fieldwork.
