In the recent years, our research was focused mainly on fortified Early Iron Age hillforts and their surrounding landscapes between the south-eastern Alps and the Pannonian plain. The complexity of this sites yields for innovative approaches, integrating
diverse methods and techniques, borrowing, adopting and adapting their methods. We have developed a research approach,
which has a firm framework, where remote sensing (e.g. ALS) and a broad array of geophysicalmethods and low-invasive archaeological methods play important roles. Besides that, the approach is flexible enough, to fit the individual landscapes and to answer
various research questions.
One of the techniques, recently included in our tool-box, is the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which has many great
applications in non-destructive revealing of geoarchaeologicaland archaeological features. Our surveys at several fortified sites
resulted in data sets of non-expected quality. During investigations of different fortification structures, e.g. ramparts, walls and
ditches, located in diverse geological settings, they were also compared with results of other traditional archaeogeophysical
