methods and finally by targeted archaeological excavations.
The more important advantages of the ERT are its contributions to the determination of position, geometry and exact depth
of buried archaeological structures and enables reliable predictions on type of constructions. As a surplus also data about the
surrounding medium are obtained, which can be applied in combination with other proxy data for interpretation of wider geoarchaeological and palaeoenvironmental contexts of either individual archaeological site and/or are areas between them.
