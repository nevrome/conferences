Prehistoric strongholds of Estonia (ca. 130 in number) represent two geologically different regions. In northern and eastern Estonia limestone bedrock is covered by rather modest layers of moraine, but in inland Estonia the Devonian sandstone has been
buried under glacial deposits of clay, gravel and sand. The retreating glaciers left different landforms in the two regions of Estonia – sea-related districts are flat, but inlands are often of hummocky character. These circumstances determine also the role
of ramparts among the prehistoric fortifications in different parts of the country. In flat areas of western Estonia the defence
system of strongholds is based not on the natural difference of heights, but on massive man-made circular ramparts. On “real”
hill forts, i.e. on hilltop or promontory strongholds, the ramparts, if existing at all, are/were of smaller dimensions.
Geological preconditions have also determined the construction material of the ramparts of Estonian prehistoric strongholds. In
limestone areas the ramparts were made of limestone, resembling those on the Swedish islands of Öland and Gotland. In inland
areas ramparts were built of earth and sand, being supported both from the inside and the outer sides by timber structures.
The chronological dimension of the ramparts of Estonia begins with the Late Bronze Age, stretching to the early 13th century and
sometimes to the first half of the 14th century. Excavations show that In several cases the ramparts were re-constructed and
extended. In some cases also gateways have been opened.
