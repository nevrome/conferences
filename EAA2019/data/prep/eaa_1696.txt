Hillforts of the Old Prussians (and preexisting Aestii) played a special role in the settlement pattern in The South-East Baltic. Data
of natural science research and radiocarbon dating indicate that they could have been used for a long time, from the Bronze Age
to the early Middle Ages. However, the issues related to the typology of hillforts in the central part of the former East Prussia are
not resolved. Available information about their structure shows that the settlements differ greatly in elements associated with
the structure of fortifications – ramparts and ditches. Data on the settlement pattern in Old Prussian’s territory indicates, that
by the beginning of the 2nd millennium it could be composed of many local centers with hillforts in a key role. But the construction
of ramparts and ditches indicates, that only some of them could perform a serious defensive function. Such hillforts are usually
located in strategically regions; readily lend itself to control the territories and resources, associated with the period of the
Teutonic Order expansion. The question is, could it have happened, that been distinguished with a fairly stable and conservative
social structure, Old Prussians could create the solid defensive constructions for their hillforts only by the 12–13 century in the
face of external conquest? Although there is still not much data, we will discuss the available information with the using a number
of modern research methods on Old Prussian hillforts, located in the central part of the modern Kaliningrad region.
