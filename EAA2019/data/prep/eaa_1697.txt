BALTIC ENCLOSURES

Presentation Format: Oral
Ramparts and ditches are the most obvious elements of prehistoric hillforts in the Baltic region and many other European landscapes. Due to their size and complexity excavations of these parts of fortification need a lot of time and hence have not been
conducted on a lot of monuments, especially in the Kaliningrad Region of Russia with its approximately 140 hillforts. Only a few
of them have been exmanied by larger excavations in 150 years of research history. The few published results show, that the
monuments have mostly been constructed from wood, earth and sometimes stones, forming several distinguishable layers or
rather phases of erection, destruction and reconstruction. But find material is sparse and often is limited to pottery fragments,
which – due to their uniform appearance and shape - are difficult to date.
Precise dating supported by natural sciences such as Radio-Carbon-analysis are available only for a few monuments in Poland,
Lithuania and Latvia, but they are absolutely absent for the Kaliningrad Region.
In the context of a bigger project on settlement archaeology, conducted by the Centre for Baltic and Scandinavian Archaeology
in Schleswig and the Museum of Prehistory and Early History in Berlin and financed by the Academy of Sciences and Literature
Mainz, the author developed a new strategy for the dating of hillforts. Using a motor driven drilling equipment for sampling data-
