ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF SLAVONIC STRONGHOLDS AND THEIR RAMPARTS

Presentation Format: Oral
Among the most impressive monuments of early and high medieval settlement in the south-western Baltic region, are undoubtedly Slavonic strongholds, which constitute a dense network in the area between the Rivers Elbe and Vistula. These strongholds
were preferably built within natural protective locations: e.g. on mountain spurs and on steep slopes (hill forts), in lowlands or on
islands. The ramparts were built of wood and earth, whereby simple plank wall constructions as well as complex wooden installations like timerlaced and box constructions could increase the stability of the rampart embankments. As a result, high and steepwalled fortifications were created, which were difficult to attack and enabled an effective defense, especially since additional
wooden wall-walks were probably built on the ramparts. The paper should give a brief overview on the constructions of several,
well-excavated Slavonic strongholds to enable a discussion about dating and distribution of different building techniques within
the north-western Slavonic region.
