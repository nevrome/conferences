FORTIFIED SITES

Presentation Format: Oral
Survey of aerial images and LIDAR data have been most intensivelly applied airborne remote sensing methods in the field of
archeological research for several decades. The use of these methods for archeology has some advantages that should be
mentioned - it is the quickest and non-destructive source of information on the scale of single archeological site and particular
segment of cultural/archaeological landscape.
Research of fortified sites in Lithuania was carried ou with the help of descriptions based on the results of field survey which was
done in more or less professional and scientific manner since the beginning of the 20th century. The aim of this presentation
to demonstrate how remote sensing techniques could be applied to suvey Prehistoric-Early Medieval fortifications which are
taken on historical aerial photographs. The scale, construction and position in the cultural landscape of fortified archaeological
structures seen in the Second World War provides an ideal basis to compare how they were modiﬁed during the course of time. It
will be worth not to be mentioned that application of airborne remote sensing methods and techniques provide an effective and
low-cost instrument for the scientiﬁc investigations.
