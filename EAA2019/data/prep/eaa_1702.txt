A large number of hillforts protected by three lines of ramparts were uncovered in the vast area of forest zone in the Eastern
European Plain. On the territory from the river Western Dvina on the West to the Nizhniy Novgorod region’s part of the river Oka
on the East there are data about the presence of fortifications in 576 settlements. Among them 278 sites have one line of ramparts, 145 – two lines and only 79 – three lines. The last group consists 8-10% from the total number of the Iron Age sites. Except
the Iron Age the layers belonging to the 3rd quarter of the 1st millennium AD are fixed on these sites.
Multivallate hillforts form several clusters on large rivers – the Volga, the Oka, the Moskva-river, the Ugra, the Sozh, the Kasplya.
The cluster, located in Zvenigorod part of the Moskva-river’s middle flow, between the mouths of the river Ruza and the river Setun, is mostly investigated in detail. Here 8 settlements with three lines of ramparts were fixed: Lutsino, Savvino-Storozhevskoe,
Dunino, Uspenskoe, Barvihinskoe, Znamenskoe, Dyatlova, Kuntsevo. All of them are situated on the distance of 5-7 km from each
other.
Most of settlements with three lines of ramparts are related to several types. The type 1 is multivallate hillforts on narrow elongated capes, located on small rivers, not far from their mouths. There are many hillforts of this form in the middle flow of the
Moskva-river. The type 2 is round hillforts with ring ramparts. They are mainly situated in the Western regions of the Eastern
European Plain.
There is still no answer to the question about the purpose of this type of sites. There are several versions of its interpretations:
clusters of multivallate hillforts mark «local centers» requiring more protection; multivallate hillforts are worship objects.
