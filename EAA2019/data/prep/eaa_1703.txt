The site of La Villeneuve-au-Châtelot is located in the Seine Valley, northeastern France. Starting in 2013, developer-funded
excavations at this large site, which is part of a wider network of enclosed neolithic sites that extend over more than 4 km², have
fully excavated almost 20 ha, mostly in the inner-space of the enclosure. The site was fortified by a single wood fence or wall
which encloses a very large area, probably between 45/50 ha. More than 450 fragments of the wooden planks - extending over
725 lm - making up the palisade were well preserved in situ due to the wetland environment.
In this paper, we first present the methodological challenges of identifying, excavating and recording a fortification on this scale,
with the second part discussing the structure in detail. This includes details of both the natural resources exploited and technological aspects used to construct the structure : how were the individual wooden planks shaped and joined together, how were
the planks put in place (with 9 tons of broken millstones re-used as shimstones); and what was the form of the enclosure, including its gateways, interruptions, and overall layout ? Then, we place the wider enclosed site into the landscape, starting with the
small scale (the topography of the enclosure), and expanding to show its relationship to other enclosed sites within the vicinity.
In this way, the history of fortification, as both physical and political boundary, can be highlighted.
