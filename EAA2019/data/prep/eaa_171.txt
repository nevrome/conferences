Most of prehistoric funerary archaeology studies address the scarcity of non-adult individuals in relation to what it should be
expected in pre-industrial societies, which have high infant and juvenile mortality rates. However they rarely explore its eventual
causes and limits. For example, were babies the only missing members in cemeteries? Or did this underrepresentation also affect older children? Differential funerary treatment towards non-adults is another topic commonly approached by researchers.
But, is this present in every age group? Are their burials really different compared to those of adults? And can we see in the funerary record at what time a boy or a girl is considered as an adult? To deal with those questions more than one hundred non-adult
graves from the IIIrd-IInd Millennium BC in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula have been analyzed. This study, which includes both
archaeological (structures, grave goods, position of the body) and bioanthropological variables (age, sex, pathologies) seeks
potential age-related funerary patterns and their differences with those of adults.
