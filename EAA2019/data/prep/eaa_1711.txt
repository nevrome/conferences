Presentation Format: Oral
The World Heritage site of Müstair, Grisons, Switzerland, is one of the best studied monasteries in Europe, thanks to decades of
archaeological research. Founded in Carolingian times, it has maintained its original function as a monastic site. Thanks to this
long history, the monastery complex comprises buildings from many different eras between the late 8th and the 20th century.
The proposed paper will focus on the earliest construction phase, which has been dated by dendrochronology to around AD 775.
A large number of archaeological features can be attributed to the Carolingian construction site: trenches, post-holes, fills, as
well as imprints on soil and mortar. They offer insights into the organization of the building site and the progression of the work.
Petrographic analyses on mortars and raw materials from Müstair are currently being carried out. They will complement and
expand our knowledge about Carolingian building techniques at the site. Some preliminary results from these analyses will be
presented in the paper.
