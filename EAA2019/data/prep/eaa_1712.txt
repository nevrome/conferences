Throughout the Roman and medieval period, ‘machines’ like cranes were used on major building sites. But mortar seems to have
been exclusively mixed by hand, i.e. with hoes and shovels. An exception is the period between ca. AD 650-1050 when simple
mechanical devices were developed across Europe allowing for the mortar to be prepared in pits with a mill-like turning device
that could be operated by humans or by draught animals. These devices seem to have been used rather in remote places and in
pioneer situations than in urban centers with continuous stone building tradition (Hueglin 2011 & 2017).
Extensive archaeological excavations around the Abbey of Saint John at Müstair in the Swiss Alps have brought forth remains of
altogether six mortar mixers from two building phases. With this, the ancient Benedictine monastery – declared a UNESCO World
Heritage site in 1983 – boasts the highest number of mortar mixers when compared with – currently – forty plus other sites
across Europe. The Carolingian example – with a diameter of 3.20-3.40 m one of the largest devices – is from around AD 770790. The other five – with diameters of ca. 1.90 m much smaller – cluster around the so-called Planta tower, one of the oldest
fortified residential towers in the Alps, added to the monastery around AD 960. The current SNF-project “Mortar Technology and
Construction History at Müstair Monastery” is addressing the question about the specific uses of these mechanical devices.
