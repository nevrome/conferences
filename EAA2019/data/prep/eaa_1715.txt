objects and features which range from the Early Bronze Age with some interruptions to the 20th century. These discovered
structures were used for different purposes: they served as shepherd huts and shelters, as pens for counting goats and sheep,
and as elongated rectangular shelters for cows and small livestock. The rectangular shelters had a wooden lean-to roof covered
with wooden shingles, whereas the roof construction with the other drywall buildings is mostly unknown. Depending on the dating evidence and the preservation status, often ethnological and historical comparisons have to aid reconstructions. Another
problem is posed by the stone walls which were mentioned in post-medieval written sources. These stone walls functioned as
border between the various real estates which were owned by different alpine farmerÂ´s cooperatives. It continues to be difficult
to figure out with archaeological methods age and function not only of the stone walls but also of some of the other structures.
