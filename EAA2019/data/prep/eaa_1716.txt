Since 2000, we have taken interest in the medieval peopling of the low mountain ranges in the Auvergne region of France. We
selected two zones of studies: the first in the south of the Cantal Department where we conducted the largest part of our
research and the second in the south of the Sancy Massif, beginning in 2013. Our work consists of survey, cataloging, testing,
and paleoenvironmental analyses. Two broad categories of structures were recorded. The first corresponds to large elongated structures with stone walls. Our research indicates that these occur either as isolated farms or grouped in small hamlets,
occupied most probably year-round within a framework of agro-pastoral exploitation of the landscape. These structures were
semi-subterranean and carefully protected against the cold. They date to the period between the end of the 10th and the 12th
centuries. In one hamlet, all houses were stone built, except for one, which was built with wood.
From the 13th century, the local economy saw a profound transformation, with generalized seasonal cattle breeding. Permanent
occupation ceases and the big stone structures are replaced by small square structures which were used as shelters and shepherdsâ€™ sheds. These sheds were transformed and improved during modern era.
