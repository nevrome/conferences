adventurous archaeologists, artists and other innovative and creative thinkers. In our ‘inspiration’ section you find enthusing
projects like international film festivals or international archaeology events. And most definitely, do not try to re-invent the wheel
by yourself. Different tools are available to help organize your own activities. Are you eligible for a subsidy? And how can you get
teenagers and youngsters involved with your project? How do you get the press involved? You can find answers to these and
more questions in our ‘Tools’ section.
