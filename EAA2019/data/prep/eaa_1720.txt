In 2018 the first Dutch ‘Archaeology Night’ took place in the Dutch Royal Museum of Antiquities (www.archeologiedagen.nl/
archeonacht). It was initiated by the Dutch foundation, the National Archaeology Days and aims to become an annual event.
Archaeology Nights are evening-long programs of workshops, tours, performances, Virtual Reality and fascinating talks by young
archaeologists. The focus is to attract a younger and wider audience to archaeology. To achieve this goal we believe in programming not only for, but also by youngsters. Therefore the Archaeology Night was programmed by a recently founded platform and
think tank of young professionals united by their work and interest in public archaeology, called the Young Underground Professionals.
For Archaeology Night, the Young Underground Professionals aim to create a program in which the boundaries between archaeology and other disciplines, such as spoken word, literature and theatre, are crossed. The idea behind this is that archaeology has
so many beautiful stories to share and art, performance and other cultural expressions could provide the emotional ‘touch’ with
which to tell these stories.
