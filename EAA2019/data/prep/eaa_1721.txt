Archaeology is fascinating! It brings pictures of ancient temples, pyramids and gold to mind. But what about local archaeology?
Only rarely do excavations at one’s doorstep unearth superlatives. The facts and stories they bring to light are equally interesting, though.
After severe cost cuts in some archaeology departments the question arose about how we could convey the importance of a
science that is almost invisible and not obviously relevant to daily life to the public?
Inspired by three similar projects in other countries the idea of the Archäomobil was born. On the occasion of the European
Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 the archaeology department in Schaffhausen in collaboration with the association ”Archäologie
mobil” (mobile archaeology) set up a pilot project. To start with, the archaeology department’s transport van was given a new
look. Shovels and other tools had to make room for an unusual load: 26 boxes full of artefacts, one for every municipality of the
canton. Archäomobil’s tour involved five official stops at schools as well as public spaces. Local communities were invited to
visit the Archäomobil, talk to archaeologists and have a unique look at artefacts usually stored away in a depot and not publicly
accessible.
The project’s aims were to:
•
display artefacts at the sites they were originally found, some of them many years ago.
•
make local archaeology visible and tangible.
•
convey knowledge and share results from the forefront of research
•
get in touch with people who don’t (often) go to museums.
In my talk I will present our project, reflect on experiences and problems we faced and discuss upcoming challenges and opportunities.
