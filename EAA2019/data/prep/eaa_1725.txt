ARTEFICTION. THE POWER OF STORIES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL OUTREACH
Author(s): Dielemans, Linda (Artefiction)
Presentation Format: Oral
Getting an audience to engage with archaeology is a difficult job. The theory and practice of it are not always as attractive to people as we might wish. In this paper I propose the use of fiction to communicate archaeological research. I will argue this through
examples from my own experience as an archaeologist and author of children’s novels. These two occupations may seem contradictory, representing facts versus fantasy, but I hope to show that fiction is not necessarily a replacement or distortion of
science, but rather an easy and engaging road towards it. By writing adventurous novels, I challenge a large audience, mainly
children, to look beyond the story and discover the archaeological framework the story is built on. I try to achieve this by providing
an explanatory afterword, additional information on my website, and school class visits. To evaluate the impact of my work, sales
numbers and library loans are good indicators, as well as online presence. For this paper, I have also made use of an online survey
to assess the reader’s willingness to actively search for more details about the archaeology behind the stories for themselves.
