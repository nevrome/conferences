MIGRATING PEDAGOGIES : A CASE STUDY IN SOCIALLY ENGAGED ARCHAEOLOGY
Author(s): Stevens, Fay (University of Notre Dame - U.S.A. - in England)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper presents the outcomes of a new course in socially engaged archaeology taught at The University of Notre Dame
(U.S.A.) in England. It considers why socially engaged archaeology is important and explores the contribution such an approach
can make to the discipline and beyond. Themes include issues of voice, reflexivity, identities and a pedagogy of curation. This
discussion will focus on research and collaboration with the Museum of Migration, London and will make reference to student
engagement with the museum and resulting research and outcomes. The focus of attention will be on the exhibition ‘Room to
Breathe’ and will draw upon student responses to the exhibition, engagements with exhibition contributors and collaboration
with the museum curators. This will lead to a closer consideration on the topic and relevance of socially engaged archaeology as
well as adopt a wider discussion on the philosophy of socially engaged archaeology and stories of migration.
