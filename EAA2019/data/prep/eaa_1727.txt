PEERS, PARTNERS, AND MENTORS: ESTABLISHING A NETWORK OF HERITAGE EDUCATORS
Author(s): Thomas, Ben (Archaeological Institute of America)
Presentation Format: Oral
At the 2018 EAA meeting in Barcelona, participants in a session on Archaeology and Public Engagement presented overviews of
various outreach methods and useful evaluation and assessment practices that have been developed in various countries. One
of the topics that emerged in the discussion that followed was the need for the creation of a network of professionals engaged
in the creation and presentation of outreach activities. In this paper the author presents the results of a series of workshops
and conferences for heritage educators that were organized by the author and his colleague and conducted around the United
States. The author discusses the issues involved with the organization of these meetings, the topics that were discussed at the
various gatherings, and the results of these efforts. Issues discussed at the meetings included the lack of a statement of ethics
governing the creation and implementation of outreach efforts, the need for general guidelines to assist practitioners, and the
ability to access a network of peers for consultation, partnership, and mentorship in addition to general support. The author
hopes that through this presentation, we will be able to discuss the feasibility of expanding the support network internationally
in an ongoing effort to create a robust and collaborative approach to public outreach and engagement.
