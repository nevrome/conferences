ROUNDTABLE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HERITAGE (CCH)
Theme: Global change and archaeology
Organisers: Biehl, Peter F (University at Buffalo, SUNY) - Dalen, Elin (Riksantikvaren/Directorate for Cultural Heritage) - Martens Vandrup, Vibeke (Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research - NIKU)
Format: Round table
This third roundtable organized by the EAA Community Climate Change and Heritage (CCH) has two main objectives: (1) to provide an update on the work done in and by the community since the Barcelona meeting including a CCH action plan – to be circulated prior to the meeting -, and (2) to discuss ways to translate fundamental archaeological research into actionable science to
inform decision making as well as monitor climate change as it relates to archaeology and heritage. We will invite representatives
of key archaeology associations such as the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), Society for American Archaeology (SAA)
and World Archaeological Congress (WAC) and others as well as specialists in climate change and heritage research as a sounding board for the EAA Community Climate Change and Heritage (CCH) action plan as well as opinion leaders in methods and practice of climate change and heritage research. It is also planned to discuss a ‘Bern Declaration for Climate Change and Heritage’.
