THE FIRST YOUNGSTERS OF A NEW AGE: JUVENILES IN THE NEOLITHIC OF HUNGARY
Author(s): Anders, Alexandra (Eötvös Loránd University, Institute of Archaeological Sciences, Budapest)
Presentation Format: Oral
The presentation offers an overview of the graves containing juvenile burials from the 6th and 5th millennia BC in Hungary, a
subject that was wholly absent from the discourse of earlier studies. Despite the assumed demographic profile of early agrarian
populations, this age group is usually underrepresented in the prehistoric mortuary record, making it a genuine challenge to
gather all the available mortuary data on them. Contextualising the life and afterlife of juveniles in the light of the latest results
of bioarchaeological investigations will complement this information as well.
Can we detect any differences in the non-adult age distribution across different juvenile age ranges in lifestyle and mortuary
rites? What are the reasons underlying the underrepresentation of juveniles? How were their bodies treated? Although juveniles
did receive grave goods, their burials do not rank among the rich graves with a few notable exceptions. What kinds of situations
are represented in the cases of lavishly furnished burials? Were the grave goods found in juvenile burials genuine personal belongings from this life or were they rather expressions of their fulfilled or prospected social status? Where were their burials deposited – together with the community of adults, or separate from them? Was age, especially young age, a structuring principle
in the communities? What was the role of juveniles in Neolithic communities? Can we detect changes through the millennia, from
the Early to the Late Neolithic, and in different regions of Hungary?
