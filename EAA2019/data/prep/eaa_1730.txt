Format: Regular session
Archaeological collections are invaluable sources for reconstructing different aspects of the histories of archaeology. The study
of archival documents, publications and newspaper articles related to the constitution and later evolution of such collections
brings us insights into the development of archaeological theory and practice, the emergence of interdisciplinarity, as well as
into the production and circulation of scientific knowledge across time. It also reveals the potential and role of archaeological
collections in identity construction, and in shaping various types of networks and power relationships within the discipline of
archaeology.
This session aims to unveil the invisible stories behind both private and public archaeological collections in Europe and beyond,
from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. We welcome papers that explore topics such as the agendas and ideologies behind
collecting, researching and exhibiting archaeological objects and collections; the scientific narratives built around collections;
the contribution of collections to the evolution of archaeological interpretations and to fostering pluri- and interdisciplinary collaborations and investigations; the role(s) of collections in the production, transfer and exchange of knowledge, as well as in
building local, regional and national identities. We would also like to encourage discussions about the hierarchies and networks
(e.g., social, academic) that were formed around collections between locals, collectors, amateurs, and professionals, in addition
to their involvement in the birth and development of archaeological societies and museums.
