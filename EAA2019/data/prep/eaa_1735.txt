Artes de San Fernando in Madrid produced plaster casts and still today offers the “wounded lioness” in its catalogue. One might
wonder about the reasons for this choice. What was the main issue: the quality of the casts, diplomatic relations between Spain
and the United Kingdom, or both? In this communication I will consider these and other questions in order to assess, on the one
hand, the extent of international networking and, on the other, the role of cast collections in transferring knowledge of the archaeology of the ancient Near East in Spain at the turn of the twentieth century.
