ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK

Although the research area of Sir Aurel Stein fell outside of Europe, two European countries consider this great explorer of the
20th century their own: the country he was born in, Hungary, and the country he served as an archaeological superintendent,
Great Britain. Consequently, these two countries have archives containing much material relating to Stein’s archaeological explorations (the Library and Information Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Bodleian Libraries University of
Oxford). The scattered nature of the material makes it challenging for the researcher to draw a complete picture, which emerges
only after the cross-collection comparison and analysis has been executed. Stein’s unpublished exploration of the lost Sarasvati
River in British India gives a good example how the parallel examination of archival photographs in Hungary, letters and diary
notes in England and stored artefacts in India can allow us to make visible the lost archaeological results from the last century
and explore Stein’s identity in Colonial India.
