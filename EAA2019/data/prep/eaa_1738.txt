Established in 1962, the ‘Museu Monográfico de Conimbriga’ (‘Conimbriga Monographic Museum’) exhibits exclusively artefacts
from the roman site of Conimbriga intermittently excavated since the end of the 19th century. His first director was João M.
Bairrão Oleiro (1923-2000), professor at the University of Conimbriga, after getting a specialization abroad on roman art and
archaeology. Committed to improve roman archaeology in the country, Bairrão Oleiro succeeded in transforming Conimbriga into
a field school for students aiming to became archaeologists. Moreover, he was able to interconnect classes, fieldwork, museum
studies and editing work whilst opened the way to institutional and international collaboration.
Aware of the role played by this site in the academic career of Bairrão Oleiro, and of Bairrão Oleiro in the safeguarding of this
site, we aim now to understand, based on new archive material, how he used the site - specially the Museum collections -, as a
way to: 1. identify the University of Coimbra as a national epicenter of roman archaeological studies; 2. stimulate national and
international collaboration; 3. integrate scientific networks; 4. build scientific narratives; 5. promote heritage politics; 6. develop
archaeology in the country, encouraging interdisciplinary approaches.
