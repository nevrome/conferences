At the beginning of the 20th century George Bonsor bought the castle of Mairena del Alcor with the objective of creating and
furnishing a museum with the artifacts, photographs and manuscripts coming from his excavations at the Region of “Los Alcores”. His goal was to build an archaeological museum to convey the site-specific story of the southwest of Spain in the broader
context of protohistory. The exchange of information and artifacts with national an international amateur, museum curators and
scholars specialized in various fields helped to raise his collections and the character of the institution and created an active and
strong network that contributed to the implementation of the latest practices in archaeological research, displays and museum
management. With the aim of publicising the museum and positioning it on tourism routes in province, he conceived a comprehensive communication and promotion strategy that led the monument being marketed by major national and international agencies. Its collections and the own monument were included in the official programme of the Ibero-American Exhibition of Seville
in 1929 and national and international tourists, scholars and scientist like the Marquis of Cerralbo Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa,
Pierre Paris, Raymond Lantier or Manuel Gómez Moreno visited the castle attracted by its collections. This paper aims to explore
and analyze the impact of the project.
