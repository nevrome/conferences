of collections, if so, whether this happened in all the different disciplines with which archaeology collaborated. A distinction
will be made on the different major periods in the history of archaeology. Attention will also be paid on whether geography and
nationality may have been an important factor in the particular ways women engaged in interdisciplinarity. Finally, there will be an
assessment on the particular context in which interdiscplinarity in the study of collections took place. After providing a general
context the paper will focus on women who were born in the first decades of the twentieth century. Women who will be mentioned in the paper include the palynologists Arlette Leroi-Gourhan (1913 - 2005), Josefina Men√©ndez Amor (1926 - 1985) and
the paleobotanist Maria Hopf (1913 - 2008).
