Presentation Format: Oral
The shell mounds (sambaquis) located along Brazilian coast have drawn attention since the sixteenth century, due to their dimensions, visibility and artefacts, but scientific research only began in the middle of the twentieth century. At the coast of São Paulo
State (Southeastern Brazil) the first excavations, with scientific approach and interdisciplinary teams, started in the 1950s
under the leadership of Paulo Duarte and a great collaboration with French archaeologists Paul Rivet, Director of the Musée de
l’Homme (Paris, France), Joseph Emperaire and Annette Laming-Emperaire. The first archaeological excavations, carried out at
Maratuá shell mound, contributed to the understanding of the shell mounds with modern methodological approaches, and to
the formation of Brazilian archaeologists. A long-term project, held by the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, University of
São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil), a public institution, investigates the archaeological collections stored in the museum, and associated records from different shell mounds excavated from the 1950s to 2010s. In addition to the artefacts and samples, the
archaeological archive includes paper documents (notebooks, drawings, site maps, site records, project reports, publications,
correspondence) and photographic records (colour slides, colour prints, black and white prints, negatives). Special attention is
given to the organization, digitalization and safeguard of documents and photographic collections. At the same time, collections-based research is being conducted on lithic and shell artefacts, integrating past and current projects. This paper intends
to review and discuss the history and development of the archaeological research undertaken in shell mounds at São Paulo State
coast, its important contribution to the understanding of the archaeological record and sambaqui societies, and its influence on
the history and trajectory of Brazilian archaeology.
