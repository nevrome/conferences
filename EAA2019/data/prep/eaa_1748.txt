ongoing strategy to systematically digitize the Bronze Age archaeological records collection at the National Museum of Denmark
as well as efforts to make the archiveâ€™s records accessible online. We highlight the importance of these types of efforts in the
contexts of the transfer and exchange of knowledge by museums, and describe how contemporary archaeological research is
augmented by access to such legacy documents. Finally, we discuss these efforts as an integral responsibility of museums
in the Digital Age and offer insights into implementation of the digitization undertaking thus far, with the aim to provide new
insights into Nordic Bronze Age identity.
