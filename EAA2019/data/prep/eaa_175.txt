ronment, including family/adults connection. Thus the paper will deal with bioarchaeological investigation, which is being undertaken for Bronze Age steppe population of the Southern Trans-Urals with emphasis on studying subadults. Three kurgans (burials
mounds) of various sizes were excavated by Russian-German team nearby Neplyevsky village in Chelyabinsk region. The excavation of kurgans was accompanied with field anthropological observation and special attention to taphonomy of intact skeletons
as well as isolated bones found beyond burial chambers. All skeletal remains were examined for osteological and paleopathological changes. The recovered interments were modest in terms of grave-goods but were impressive by funeral expenditure as
marked by rock-clay constructions. Small kurgans 5 and 9 yielded only 6 sub-adult skeletal remains; while the biggest kurgan 1
enclosed single and double burials of estimated 44 individuals attributed to different age categories with significant prevalence
of children and juveniles. There is no any specifics of spatial organization for both adults and sub-adults graves found in the biggest kurgan. Although for children we discern notable diverse of pottery location, pictograhs depicted on pots, etc. Small number
of double and secondary burials was found among all age categories, i.e. pre-adult, prime adult and elder. The age profile of the
subadult sample is in agreement with high infant mortality (0-2 years, about 30% of the total sample) which decreases gradually
being minimal at late childhood and juvenile stages. Such mortality rate is not unique but always of particular interest and induces various interpretations. Thus paper describes archaeological and anthropological evidence as well as contributes to general
scholarship concerning archaeology of childhood by providing new bioarchaeological and contextual information.
