LOGISTICS BEHIND ROMAN BUILDING MATERIAL IN THE NETHERLANDS

Presentation Format: Oral
Since 2000 the authors have been investigating Roman heavy goods (ceramic and stone building material) deriving from 40
commercially excavated sites in the Netherlands.
From every site reference samples are collected, documented and stored. The ultimate aim of the project is to connect fabrics
with producers and ascribe stones to quarries and discern the provenance of the natural resources. Through the years a large
reference collection has been built up. With every new investigated site the collection provides a greater opportunity to postulate new hypotheses and arrive at exciting conclusions.
This lecture will discuss why it is so important to study the logistics of heavy goods, in particular the organization of the construction of roman roads, forts and public buildings. Can we unravel the strategy behind roman logistics? Can we estimate the
volumes and type of transportation and the impact on society? Can we recognize a division between military and civil trade and
transport? How does the movement of military units relate to the movement of goods?
Using some case studies from the Netherlands the authors will show how new ways of approaching the material can provide us
with new insights.
