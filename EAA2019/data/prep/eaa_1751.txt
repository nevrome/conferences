The oppidum of Bibracte, chief town of the Aedui territory, is the earliest Gallic site in the North-Eastern Gaul where Roman
building materials appear. Thus, near the middle of the 1st century BC, tiles (tegulae and imbrices) and bricks are used for the
coverings and the masonries, while most of the construction is characterized by perishable resources.
The analysis of these materials is founded on a consequent corpus gathering more than ten thousand fragments. Moreover, they
show the mobilization of significant volumes of clay and sands to produce these building elements before their transport. The
origin of the natural resources is a crucial question that can be addressed with petrographic observations (macro- and microscopic determination methods).
The use of bulk materials for construction purposes in the oppidum of Bibracte expresses the Gauls’ economical needs by the exploitation of local natural resources to implement new construction methods requiring new know-how in a Romanization context.
Indeed, the petrographic observations allow us to consider that all the terracotta materials are produced with sands and clays
that can be found in a 5-kilometer perimeter, even if the precise tile factories are not localized. Furthermore, the petrographic description for some bricks, used as opus spicatum flooring in an Augustan domus of Bibracte, particularly differs from the common
materials implemented in the oppidum and allows us to consider of imports manufactured products, in the case of precise needs
