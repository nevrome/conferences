In the early first century AD the flood plain below the Roman small town of Studen/Petinesca (Switzerland) was the site of a large
engineering project. An elaborate embankment made out of stone, gravel and timber posts straightened the riverâ€™s edge, it may
have served as landing for cargo boats. The bank also protected a parallel running road that ended on a timber bridge crossing
the river Aare. Both roads and waterways link Studen/Petinesca well with the provincial capital (Avenches/Aventicum) and much
of the province.
From 2009-2011 it was possible to excavate a 100m stretch of the embankment, the road and the remains of the bridge. The
preservation of a large number of timbers in waterlogged layers together with the significant surface area examined provide several lines of investigation into questions of logistics and the supply of raw materials. A small number of inhumations associated
with the construction phase of the bank may shed light on social aspects of the construction process.
This contribution intends to reflect not only on the volumes of resources consumed in this building project, but also on the construction sequence as well as the regional origins and transport of the quarry stones and mainly oak timber posts. Dendrochronology allows tight dating of the structures and ongoing research may shed light on questions of forest management in Roman
Switzerland.
