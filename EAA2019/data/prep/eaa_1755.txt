The Swedish mining area Bergslagen is situated north and west of the lake Mälaren. Stockholm, the capitol of Sweden, is located
by the rapids, where the lake flows into the Baltic Sea. The introduction of industrialized mining has had a crucial bearing on our
understanding of medieval Scandinavian history, the urbanization of the Mälar valley and the colonization and organization of
mining areas. Circa 700 mediaeval blast furnace sites and more than 10 000 mines are identified, ancient monuments that provide possibilities to interpret the earliest industrialization and its implication on woodlands, rivers and lakes. In the Nordic sagas
the mining area was called the Land of Carrying Iron (“Järnbärarland”). Ore, wood and charcoal were moved to the blast furnace
sites, from which iron was transported on land, water and ice to fortified towns. The long heavy transportation required various special constructions in the landscape and a combination of transport systems on land and water. Stockholm was founded
where the traders were forced to transship the iron from small boats to bigger ships.
One site in particular, Lapphyttan, contributes to a better understanding of land use and daily work at a blast furnace site. The excavations show a sophisticated industrial facility in the 13th century. Ores of different qualities were used from five to six mines
