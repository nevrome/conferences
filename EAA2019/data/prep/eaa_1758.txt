With the beginning of the Holocene, the development of water conditions played a crucial role for Mesolithic societies. The areas
of the Baltic seashore, Lakelands and net of rivers, played one of the most important factor in advance of fishing activities which
started to become one of the main subsistence strategies in that time.
The Mesolithic hunters, develop many kinds of tools and methods of exploitation of the water environment and Polish lands provided many archaeological and archaeoichthyological premises supporting the assumption that fishing was very important part
of their life. Bone artefacts, in a form of hooks, points or harpoon-heads, discovered in fillings of the Polish lakes, rivers, wetlands
or swamps, represent a unique evidence of cultural, practical and technological development in that time. Besides mentioned
artefacts, the next evidence of fishing activities are represented by ichthyofaunal remains found on some archaeological sites,
like Dąbki, Dudka, Miłuki and Mszano.
The paper id presented the most important finds of Mesolithic osseous artefacts generally associated with fishing activities
from Poland and discuss about their role and function in the light of performed contextual and traceological studies. Except that
we will report archaeoichthyological data from the mentioned sites and also new Mesolithic assemblages recovered in Paliwodzina and Ludowice in the central Poland. These two different type of data will be used for evaluation of fishing and strategies of
fish caches by Mesolithic societies.
