The funeral rites of the immature individuals is one of the most interesting aspects of the burial research of Neolithic population.
This is due to the fact, that in this period there were existed many different patterns of the proceeding with the immature dead.
This is probably the result of the diversity in the social status of juveniles and their treatment in various religious systems. The
perfect example of the social-religion changes, which took place in the area north of the Sudeten and Carpathians is the multicultural necropolis form Eneolithic and Early Bronze Age at site 2 in Książnice in southern Poland. Within a seventeen years of the
regular archaeological excavations there were discovered several dozen burials belonged to the archaeological cultures dated
from the early 4th to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. Many of these graves belonged to individuals at the age of Infans
or Iuvenis. The aim of our paper is to show the different customs connected with burial rites of immature individuals depending
on the respected traditions. Our study include funeral customs of the Lublin-Volhynian culture which was the most northern enclave of the Carpathian Copper Age civilisation then communities of the Złota culture – the local syncretic group of the Globular
Amphora culture as well as individuals of the Corded Ware culture from the second part of the 3rd millennium BC.
