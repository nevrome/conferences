A long history of excavation beginning already in 1874 had revealed two Stone Age burials as well evidence for the lives of those
interred and others who lived at the locality. Two additional burials were discovered during excavations in 2017 and 2018 and,
intriguingly, one of them appears to have been accompanied by grave offerings of fish. We will highlight findings from the burial of
a middle-aged man found in 2017 and associated grave finds. ZooMS (peptide mass fingerprinting) results from a grave feature
dominated by bones of the perch family (Percidae) have helped to clarify identifications of bones from very small individuals of
perch (Perca fluviatilis) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua). Although analysis is ongoing, preliminary results suggest both that
small fish were an important component of the overall subsistence regime during the site’s occupation – and that this particular
deposit is unusual because of the overwhelming predominance of very young fish and the preeminence of the perch family. Our
investigations at Riņņukalns emphasize the role of fishing in life and death for these prehistoric hunter-gatherers.
