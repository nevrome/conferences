Presentation Format: Oral
Based on historic sources, mass harvesting of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) formed the
basis of the coastal river economy in NW Finland far into the 20th century. The prehistoric origin of this nutritional source is
however much less known because salmon bones are very rare at archaeological sites in northern areas. As a result, there are
serious gaps in our knowledge concerning the antiquity of northern salmon fisheries and their impacts on shaping biodiversity,
hunter-gatherer adaptations, and human-ecological networks. The incredibly low number of salmon remains in Finnish archaeofaunal assemblages have also been explained as reflecting not only poor preservation and coarse excavation techniques, but
also processing, storage, and waste disposal which may be key factors affecting the representation of salmonid remains at
archaeological sites. However, rare minerals formed in burned salmonid bones can preserve at prehistoric sites, thus informing
on the early utilisation of these resources. Fine sieving and mineralogical analyses along with zooarchaeological identification
of recovered bone fragments in hearth sediments from the c. 5,600-year-old Yli-Ii Kierikinkangas site on the Iijoki River have
confirmed for the first time that the people living at this village did incorporate salmonids into their economies. Similar novel approaches utilising archaeological soils and sediments will thus expand our knowledge of salmonid harvesting at different times
and places despite the absence of morphologically classifiable fish bones.
