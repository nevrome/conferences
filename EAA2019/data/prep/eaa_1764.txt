Presentation Format: Poster
Complex studying of hunting and fishing equipment which include leisters, arrow, harpoon heads and fishhooks made of bone or
antler from archaeological sites of Kola Peninsula dated back to 5000 cal BC â€“ BC/AD was conducted. A classification system of
barbed harpoon heads and fishhooks was developed on the basis of morphological analysis. Four periods were defined as a result
of conjunction analysis: A (5000-2500 cal BC), B (2500-1500 cal BC), C (1500-900 cal BC), D (900-0 cal BC). Techniques of primary and secondary processing and manufacturing of 125 items from 5 sites have been identified on the basis of technological,
experimental and use-wear studying. Blanks and preforms were made by longitudinal splitting and fracturing. For secondary processing were used cutting, planing, scraping, drilling. Abrasion and polishing were used on the final stage. Most of the artefacts
were manufactured with stone tools, but traces of metal use were recognized on items from Kola Oleneostrovsky Grave field.
