Presentation Format: Oral
Early Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula resulted in changes to the urban setting of graves and cemeteries. The arrival of a seasonal liturgy that embraced loca sacra, honouring the memory of illustrious figures of the Christian faith was agent in the transformation of late-antique and early medieval townscapes. The material versatility evidenced in the reframing and design of new
funerary areas reflects Christianization, but also the status and agency of local elites. This paper argues that these processes
were influential in changing the urban landscape in Spain and Portugal, introducing new monumentalized and sacred spaces, but
that these changes were also felt in rural areas too. This presentation will focus on the structural form of the graves and tombs
that we can associate with the Christianised and ecclesiastical secular elites of the era, and their location in the developing
funerary topography. By evaluating new archaeological evidence, new thoughts can be offered on the development in Spain of
the late antique urban and rural landscape.
