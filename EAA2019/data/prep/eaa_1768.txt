LATE ANTIQUE FUNERARY ARCHAEOLOGY IN RURAL CONTEXTS: THE VIEW FROM THE NORTHWESTERN PROVINCES

Presentation Format: Oral
From the middle of the 3rd century onwards a palatable shift is visible in the inhumation of burials related to villa settlements in
the North-Western provinces. Burials and graves become more haphazard at villa settlements, shifting into occupied buildings
or formerly residential or productive abandoned zones. This is characterised by a decreasing trend in burial goods and a generally
E-W orientation by the beginning of the 5th century. This radical challenge to the Late Antique division between life and death is
part of a larger transformation of the rural landscape and is mirrored at urban sites in the 4th and 5th centuries. This new pattern
demonstrates that large-scale social change was being undergone by elite rural populations and reflected the changing patterns
and priorities of rural populations in the North-Western provinces during Late Antiquity.
This paper will introduce a dataset of villa sites in Germania, Belgica and Britannia displaying these new forms of funerary expression and explore the reasoning behind this, arguing that new socio-economic conditions, characterised by a new style of
occupation and influenced by other factors, including the beginnings of rural Christianity affected the burial processes of villa
estates and marked the end of the Classical taboos between life and death.
