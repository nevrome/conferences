From the 3-5th centuries the Chernyakhov culture spread over the northern Black Sea area, characterized by cemeteries both
with cremations and inhumations. Among inhumations the graves with orientation to the North are prevailing. But differing from
these in a number of burials the head of deceased has been oriented to the West. The percentage of such graves differs in the
particular cemeteries and in several regions of the culture. Often in the W-E-oriented graves the number of grave goods is less
or the inventory consists of a specific mixture in comparison to those of other inhumation graves. Therefore this burial custom
has been subject of investigations on various occasions. The interpretations of the burial rite vary - as a specific tradition of one
group within the community, as an evidence for a developed social structure or as an indication for the beginning spread of Christianity. Based on archaeological material of the last decade the paper will present the current state of research and compare the
results with findings of the adjacent area in the West and Northwest.
