This paper explores the diversity of burial practices evident in the archaeological record of Ireland in the late Roman Iron Age
to early medieval periods, and the degree to which these reflect social, cultural, ethnic or religious affiliation. This is a period in
which the general progress from cremated to unfurnished E-W aligned burial has long been appreciated, with a the appearance
of E-W unfurnished and extended inhumation occurring in the 5th century AD rather dramatically. While recent scholarship has
been reluctant to accord this development an association with conversion processes, there has similarly been very little little
integrated analysis of variability, non-normative behaviours, performance or ritual action in burial rites. This paper will present
analysis of the shifting nature of cemeteries and burial rites within sepulchral landscapes. Examining how these changed thrugh
the period in Ireland, it explores the commemorative strategies, belief, and the meaning of same from the perspective of performance within the funerary arena.
