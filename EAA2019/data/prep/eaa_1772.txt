Until recently the rich material culture from the Merovingian cemeteries in Francia were not fully understood as researchers remained under the influence of prevailing paradigms. Today, instead of believing in a forced and abrupt imposed Germanic culture
as a result of mass migrations in a depopulated area, new longue durée models are developed based on the research of some
recently excavated cemeteries. This paper will demonstrate how grave depositions and a variety in funerary practices give us
a good picture of the economic position and social dynamics of the early medieval rural communities in the northern peripheral
regions of Francia.
The research results do not deny a decrease in population in the northern periphery of Germania Secunda after the 3th-century
crisis, but in some regions there seems to be a continuity in habitation during the 4th century AD. This habitation is often characterized by a merged population consisting of the remained Gallo-Roman inhabitants and families of ‘Germanic’ laeti and foederati. The numbers of 5th- and 6th-century graves point to an increase of the population in Northern Francia. Locally some new
transrhenan settler families intermingled with the local – already mixed – inhabitants. In this period this rural communities clearly
established a new identity, resulting in the so called Frankish culture. Later on during the 7th century AD new social changes can
be noticed: the rural almost egalitarian population is shifting towards a territorial based class society. Moreover, in this northern
periphery of the Merovingian kingdom, we can see that Christianization only achieved success during the late 7th and early 8th
centuries.
