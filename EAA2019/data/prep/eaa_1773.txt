The systematic archaeological research in the site of Ibida, located in the center of Scythia province, started in 2001. The fortification system, one of the most impressive of the Lower Danube region, encloses an area of over 27 hectares. The adjoining
cemetery, located in the north and west of the fortress, has also an impressive size, amounting to about 25 hectares. This vast
area includes also a number of burials from other historical periods (Neolithic - 2 graves, Early Roman - 4 graves, Middle Ages - 11
graves), however, the absolute majority is made by Roman-Byzantine graves (160 graves). Out of the 177 burials, 161 were anthropologically analyzed. Of these, 10 are funerary features with double burials, and 7 of these comprise of adults with children.
