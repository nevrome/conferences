The present paper will detail the archaeological context, typology of tombs, as well as the grave goods, where such finds were
identified, but we will also make some anthropological references related to sex, age and pathology. Our research has revealed
so far that, in the case of adult-child double graves, newborns or infants were buried with adults (female in most cases - six of
the seven cases, the mothers, most probably). We also have three adult-adult double funerals: one of women (age of 37 and 60
respectively); one of a 50-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man; and one of men (age of 40 and 45 respectively).
One should emphasize that 6 of the 10 double graves are of the simple pit type, with or without a coffin, while the remainder were
tombs built with reused roof-tiles, stones or potsherds.
These archaeological features will subsequently allow the interpretation of their symbolic content, in correlation with the beliefs
of the provincial Roman communities in the 4th -6th century AD.
