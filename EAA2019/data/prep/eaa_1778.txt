social environments of this area. Mapping the sites from the eighthâ€“ninth centuries highlights some regions as being of a higher
density than others. This is, on one hand, due to the current level of research in which some areas are better researched than
others, and on the other hand, the picture also reflects the demographic situation of this period. In most cases, settlements are
located in regions favourable for supporting agriculture, which highlights the sedentary lifestyle of these populations. The main
source of research are 221 cemeteries attested in in the Carpathian-Danubian region, including 26 incineration cemeteries, 21
biritual and 174 - inhumation cemeteries.
The presence of a wide variety of funerary rites and rituals in the Carpathian-Danubian space does not allow us to support the
idea of a uniform society in religious terms in the eighth-ninth centuries. On the contrary, I find the coexistence of populations
with various spiritual and religious traditions in that period, which is directly shown by the discovery of incineration, biritual, and
inhumation cemeteries. Based on currently available archaeological data, we can assert that the process of conversion to Christianity was only modestly advanced north of the Lower Danube in the eighth-ninth centuries.
Historically, the Carpathian-Danubian space was not only a transit territory for nomadic populations moving from the east to
Central and South-Eastern Europe, but also an active area of cultural and ethnic interference. Thus, the ethnic and cultural attribution of archaeological discoveries in this region presents a problem to solve of variable relevance and difficulty.
