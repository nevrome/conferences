At the early medieval site Pohansko near Břeclav (CZ) was discovered a church graveyard with 152 graves. In the graves there
were recorded several ways of grave pit adjustment, among them usage of the stone in the form of a complete or symbolic
stone lining of the grave pit (in total twenty-seven times). The occurrence of the stone arrangements in the grave pits in our
territory is recorded during the Early Middle Ages in the church cemeteries and in the burial grounds near the central settlement
agglomerations of a regional or a supraregional character. This phenomenon had been appeared sometime in the second half of
the 9th century, the greatest boom is monitored in the second half of the 10th century and the first half of the 11th century, and
then slowly was faded away. The origin of this way of grave pit arrangement has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. The usage
of the stone adjustment in the grave pits is mostly related to the ancient (classical) cultural heritage and spreading Christianity
right from the area of the western and southern Europe, where the new christian religion was established at the time of existing
cultural and social structures of the Roman Empire.
