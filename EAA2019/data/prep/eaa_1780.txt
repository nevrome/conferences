Presentation Format: Oral
The transition phenomenon from the pagan religion to the Christian one and their chronology differ between the western and the
eastern parts of Europe. Many archaeologists tried on the one hand to resolve the chronology of the conversion and on the other
hand to prove the absence or presence of Christian funeral practices in Transylvania. Archaeology hasnâ€™t yet offered any arguments in favour of an overall Christian presence in Transylvania in the 9th and 10th centuries. The first half of the 11th century
still marks a period of few conclusive proofs regarding a wide spread Christianity in Transylvania.
The archaeological approaches have launched a series of assumptions about religious indicators or markers of Christianisation,
such as burial rite, direction of orientation, the frequency of burial with grave goods or with particular items (cross pendants,
coins, ornaments, egg etc.), cemeteries, churchyard and Christian buildings. Our aim is to reopen and to refine the debate. Moreover, our research will focus on the archaeological evidences concerning the diversity of burial practice, mortuary topography,
the gradual changes of the burial practice and material culture and the progress of Christianity in Transylvania in the 10th and
11th centuries.
