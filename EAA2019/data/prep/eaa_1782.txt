was no situation in which the two deceased had the same sex. The different sex of the deceased leads to the acceptance of the
hypothesis of the woman being sacrificed at the death of the man in the case of Slavic populations. We can only assume that
the marriages were mixed, taking place between Avar men and Slavic women. However, if this is true, the question arising is why
there have been so few double biritual tombs discovered or why there are only some cases in which both burial rites were used
inside the same tomb.
