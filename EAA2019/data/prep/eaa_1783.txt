The study of the late roman necropolis is one of the essential sources for the historical knowledge and reconstruction of this
period at Tomis. The importance of the city is very high, especially after the 4th century AD, when it becomes the capital of the
newly formed province of Schytia Minor. From this date on, it will be also the most important Christian center in the area. The
name of Tomis is mentioned in the ancient written sources as a bishopric center.
Over the years, archaeological research has brought to light a significant number of tombs, grouped in several areas. The necropolis is situated throughout the ancient main roads, which connected Tomis with the other important centers in the province, like
Histria and Callatis. The late roman tombs are dated from the 4th century AD until the first half of the 7th century AD. After this
date the city is abandoned, and the entire province is left under barbarian control.
