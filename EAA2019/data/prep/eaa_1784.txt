Early Medieval cemetery in Vaćani near Skradin was discovered by accident in 2010. Systematic archaeological excavations
started in 2011 (project leader is Željko Krnčević from Šibenik City Museum). So far, 18 graves have been discovered. Graves
contain finds typical for the 8th-9th century period (e. g. ceramic vessels). Most significant are burials in two late-Antique sarcophagi. In one of them (Grave 3) two iron spurs were found. The other sarcophagus (Grave 10) contained remains of two male
adults, early Carolingian sword (K-type), a pair of bronze spurs, solidus of Constantine V and glass bottle (probably of Middle
Eastern origin) as well as some other minor finds. The type of burial used for grave 10 and grave finds indicate socially privileged
individuals with possible military background. It might be expected that these individuals belong to earliest Slavic/Croat aristocracy, however, new analysis indicate that at least one of the individuals from the grave 10 is of eastern Mediterranean origin.
That raises new questions about interactions between the perceived newcomers and autochtonous population on the eastern
Adriatic coast. It is worth mentioning that the site in question is close to Roman Scardona but also to Roman and medieval site of
Bribir. Of special importance is the fact that this small graveyard can offer a glimpse into emergence of early medieval “aristocracy” in the hinterland of Roman/Byzantine coastal towns.
