CELEBRATING 25 YEARS (EAA25) OF COLLABORATION: HOW ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE EARTH
SCIENCES ARE COMING TOGETHER TO SOLVE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS
Theme: Global change and archaeology
Organisers: Burke, Ariane (Universite de Montreal) - Davis, Basil (Universite de Lausanne) - Riel-Salvatore, Julien (Universite
de Montreal)
Format: Regular session
Archaeology has always been an interdisciplinary science situated at a cross-roads between the Social and Natural Sciences. In
the past, collaborations between archaeologists and natural scientists have focussed on the production of valuable contextual
information with which to interpret the archaeological record. Over the past twenty five years archaeological research has become increasingly inter-sectorial, however. Analytical tools drawn from the Earth Sciences (geographic information systems and
machine-learning approaches, for example) have been incorporated into archaeological practise as scientists tackle questions
relating to human evolution and demography at global, continental and regional scales. Lately, scientists in the Social and Earth
Sciences have re-focused their energies towards helping to solve real-world issues, exploring what the archaeological record
can tell us about human resilience and considering the implications in a context of global climate change. This session presents
research that explores human/environment interactions in the past using methods drawn from ecological sciences and archaeological data, with a view to identifying the ecological tipping points that have affected human systems in the past in the hopes
of helping us plan for the future.
