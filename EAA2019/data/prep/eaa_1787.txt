Presentation Format: Oral
The multi-disciplinary Refugia of Futures Past project draws on archaeological and palaeontological evidence to explore the human presence on Earth beyond 2100. We describe the initial outcomes here. Current research strongly suggests that anthropogenic environmental changes are pushing the Earth’s climate and ecosystems into regimes that more closely resemble extremes
of the deep past than any period relevant to modern humans. The deeper past includes periods of extreme heating, cooling, mass
extinction and large-scale species range shifts. For hominin populations, less extreme climate change such as during periods
of glaciation, led to retreats to refugia. However, despite the copious palaeontological and archaeological research exploring
hominin and other organisms’ responses to these past ecological changes, the scope of the human occupation on future Earth
is very poorly addressed. Current efforts exploring human adaptation to environmental changes typically explore near futures
to the somewhat arbitrary date of 2100 and thus fail to account for inevitable ecological changes continuing beyond this point.
Combining current climate modelling with archaeological and palaeontological knowledge allows us to scope future ecological
conditions and baselines beyond 2100. We show how providing this more scientifically grounded description of future changes
and timelines can help us reframe the present scientific and public discourse on adaptation, such as those informing the IPCC
Assessment Reports and adaptation strategies.
