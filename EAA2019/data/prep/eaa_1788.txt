Interdisciplinary research on human-environment interaction has been the focus of the Collaborative Research Centre 806 “Our
Way to Europe”, University of Cologne, funded by the German Research Foundation since 2009. Within this framework, Project
E1 (“Population dynamics”) established a protocol to calculate site-density based population estimates for Upper and Late Paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies. The outputs are high resolution maps of population size, density and distribution in Europe for a
succession of nine Paleolithic periods. These data are temporally extended into the Holocene by estimates for central European
Mesolithic and Neolithic populations (Project D4 and LUCIFS, University of Cologne).
Population dynamics in Europe during the last 40,000 years, as observed by this approach, are presented and discussed. While
interdisciplinary work on palaeoenvironmental modeling, age models, and spatial analysis allows for testing of hypothesis on
human-environment interaction, we also discuss results in terms of socio-cultural dynamics. Modelling long term population
dynamics is accomplished by interpolating between our estimates with Logistic Equation. Our long-durée perspective on population dynamics in prehistory confirms Child’s scenario of “revolutions” with stepwise increases in human population between
epochs, as well as oscillating/cyclic changes occurring during such epochs. We understand these big transformations of human
