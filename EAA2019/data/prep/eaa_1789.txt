history as the result of feedback loops driven by economic and social changes of societies, which affected patterns of fertility
and/or mortality. On the contrary, oscillating/cyclic changes occurring during epochs of human history correlate frequently – but
not always –with climatic/environmental changes affecting humans’ habitat range and economic basis. Other factors such as
mobility and interconnectedness, and a cultural carrying capacity should also be taken into consideration. The Adaptive Cycle
Model provides a framework to approach the driving mechanisms of demographic developments in interdisciplinary investigations.
