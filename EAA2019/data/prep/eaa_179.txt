lyze data from old excavation, which normally preclude the possibility to study osteological remains. Moreover, literary sources
provide little information about children and childhood in the Etruscan times, fact that had created an apparent invisibility of
children both in the society and in the funerary studies. In order to overcome the problem, a new systematic study of some unpublished contexts found in the Etruscan Po Valley has been undertaken. These necropolises, dating to the late Iron Age, permit
to contextualize the infant funerary rituality into a broader perspective within the Etruscan society. The study will reconstruct
the funerary customs and the spatial distribution, comparing the children to the whole context. This new approach could retrieve
the normative rites and, at the same time, bring to light the anomalies. The paper will focus mainly on the new strategies and approaches developed in the first stages of this research, trying to enlighten the problems and the achieved and predicted results.
