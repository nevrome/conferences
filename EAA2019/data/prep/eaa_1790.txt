Homo sapiens is a widely distributed species able to adapt to a range of climates and environments. Nevertheless, the archaeological record indicates that climate change has caused large-scale reorganisations of human socio-ecological systems in the
past. Climate change is a complex process that operates at different spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the nature of
climate change at specific points in time is thus crucial to understanding the nature of human/environment interactions and the
mechanisms of past human resilience. Modelling climate change in the past serves a dual purpose, allowing climatologists to
refine their modelling techniques while providing environmental context for the application of spatially explicit archaeological
models of past human adaptations. Identifying the key variables that are critical disruptors of human systems has been the goal
of the Hominin Dispersals Research Group (HDRG), an international collaborative network of archaeologists and climatologists
since 2009. This paper presents an overview of the main results of this close collaboration over the past decade and discusses
how they have allowed the HDRG to address the subject of climate change in the past and how we hope to apply this knowledge
in the future.
