ARCHAEOLOGY IN A MATERIAL WORLD

Much of the work we carry out as archaeologists is done in accordance with highly principled aims of furthering human understanding and protecting cultural heritage. Although I do not doubt the importance of archaeology or the general benevolence of
archaeologists, the material foundations of our discipline - and archaeology’s effects on the material world - are perhaps more
complex than we often like to consider. In particular, archaeology is highly integrated into a fossil-fuel dependent economy which
it depends on and sometimes supports.
There are many aspects to this integration. Some examples include:
•
the reliance of the commercial archaeology sector on fossil fuel-intensive activity, including road schemes, construction and airport expansion;
•
the often controversial dependence of many museums on direct financial support from fossil fuel corporations;
•
more generally, the existence of a publicly funded research sector that relies on the financial surplus of carbon-intensive economies.
The task of decarbonising archaeology is not just a matter of changing the way that we travel, eat and commute. It is far bigger
than that, and requires us to ask significant questions regarding archaeology’s dependence on the fossil-fuel economy. As a
discipline that is highly engaged with the study of material economy, we are unusually well-equipped to answer these questions.
Turning an archaeological eye to our own discipline and understanding its relationship to extractive and environmentally destructive economic processes may be uncomfortable, but an honest reckoning could open new routes to understanding and acting
on our current predicament.
