quire it to provide leadership and act as an exemplar by contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and acting
sustainably. Stemming from this landmark legislation are regulations, orders, plans and programmes, which provide a robust
framework for transformational change across the public sector and beyond. In response to the 2009 Act, our predecessor
organisation, Historic Scotland published a Carbon Management Plan in 2011 and a Climate Change Action Plan in 2012. Over a
five year period, HS achieved a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a systematic hierarchical approach to delivering savings across its operations. Historic Environment Scotlandâ€™s Carbon Management Plan increased our ambition, explicitly
referencing national and international targets and setting carbon budget for the organisation to 2050. Our new Climate Change
and Environmental Action Plan, in development at time of writing, similarly takes an ambitious and wide-ranging approach, recognising the relevance of the Sustainable Development Goals and international reports on progress towards meeting the targets of
the Paris Agreement 2015, as well as the necessity of transformational change both internally and across the historic environment in Scotland. It addresses numerous ways in which the historic environment can respond to the challenge of a rapidly warming climate. These include adaptation, the Circular Economy and sustainable development and ensuring that our operations,
from travel and commercial activities to building management, minimise greenhouse gas emissions. This approach is intended
not just to transform our own organisation but to provide a model that can inspire and inform others across Scotland and beyond.
