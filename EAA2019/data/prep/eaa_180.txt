In the last decades, the research in Veneto (North – Eastern Italy) has identified many burial grounds, especially crematory burials, dated from IX to III century B.C. The study of these contexts has concerned the reconstruction of individual identities (especially regarding gender, status and social role of the deceased) by chronological and typological analysis of findings and by the
understanding of the funerary ritual. In this panorama, the knowledge of children burial is mainly due to two types of data: 1) osteological analysis, that clearly distinguish children’s burials from those of adults, 2) study of the composition and organization of
grave goods, that identify specific items often associated with infants (like characteristic urns, small objects, shells, astragalus
etc). Based on the analysis of different contexts, it can be currently assumed that children’s burials reflected different levels of
complexity in the funerary representation: some graves seem to be complex and particularly elaborated, while others are simpler,
others again are almost “invisible”. These differences in archaeological visibility could represent different levels of status, rank
and role of the deceased and his family and/or different ways of expressing lineage.
This paper aims to provide an overview of different funerary rituals and children’s burials in Veneto during the Iron Age with an
integrated multidisciplinary approach. By analysing specific burials as case studies , it will take in consideration all the different
types of available data that consider differences in grave structures, ritual practices and composition of the grave goods.
The aim of this paper is to delineate patterns of funerary representation of children and related changes associated with social
dynamics in a diachronic and geographical perspective.
