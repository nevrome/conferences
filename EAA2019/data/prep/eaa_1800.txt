DECARBONIZING ARCHAEOLOGY: CHOOSING A GOOD PATH
Author(s): Jensen, Anne (University of Alaska Fairbanks; Bryn Mawr College)
Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeology can inform attempts to strengthen resilience and to adapt to environmental change in a sustainable and culturally
appropriate way. However, it currently involves more carbon emissions than are good for the planet. There are obvious means to
reduce this, but some of them come with costs.
Conferences are major culprits, but they are also loci of knowledge exchange, and venues for networking and gaining professional exposure, particularly valuable for more junior scholars those who are at smaller and more remote institutions. Alternative means of presentation can substitute for some of these, but how well depends on the connectivity available, which again
privileges the centrally-located and well-resourced. Conferences in more remote locations can be positively transformative for
researchers. These costs need to be considered and managed as we decarbonize.
Fieldwork practices are also targets for decarbonizing. Increasing involvement with local communities, including for logistical
support and excavation assistance could reduce travel and shipping related emissions, as could analysis on site or at the ultimate repository.
