APPLYING THE CHAINE OPERATOIRE TO PLASTIC CUPS ; ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHODS FOR
CONSUMER PRACTICES
Author(s): Akerman, Anastasia (University Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne)
Presentation Format: Oral
As archaeologists we are used to considering an object over its lifespan, not just as how we found it. Most of us have spent many
happy hours sifting through the rubbish of long-dead people. We know that an object’s life begins at the moment of its extraction
from a raw material, and can last beyond the end of its use-cycle, disposal, and recovery by archaeologists.
But outside of the excavation we, like everybody else, have long become used to the ”throwaway culture” that is characteristic
of Western civilisation. Most of us give no further thought to single-use or easily broken, cheap plastic goods once we’ve used
them up and thrown them out. Even though we know that we are doing our descendants no favours. In this presentation I suggest
that the Chaine Operatoire be brought into every aspect of life, and the concept be integrated into the way that we manufacture
and consume goods. By introducing a way of thinking into society wherein we consider objects not just from the moment we buy
them but from the beginning of their production until after we throw them away, we can contribute to a cultural change that will
reduce waste and encourage publics to reuse and repair their posessions, as well as helping develop the closed circuit economy.
By introducing this idea into discussions about archaeology in the media, museum expositions and outreach programs we as archaeologists can transform a useful methodological tool into a technique for reducing the impacts of environmental degradation
and plastic waste.
