AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO AIR TRAVEL CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION

Presentation Format: Oral
Air travel can be largest piece of a personal carbon footprint. So it is understandable that recommendations for reducing individual carbon emissions emphasize flying less. But where carbon emissions truly matter are at the global level and air travel is
organized in a global web. While an individual decision to walk to a destination rather than drive a car does reduce emissions, an
individual decision not to fly does not mean that the plane that would have been traveled in does not make a given trip, and consequently those emissions have not been avoided. In this paper, this situation is approached with an archaeological socio-economic network analysis. Starting questions are: how far in advance would how many people would need to decide not to fly on a
given route in order for that flight not to occur (or use a smaller plane)? Can an archaeologist find enough information about this
in order to make a useful recommendation to professional colleagues? And are there archaeological analogies that can assist
