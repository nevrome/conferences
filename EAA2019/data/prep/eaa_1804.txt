ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY BETWEEN GEOETHICS AND THE RADICAL ENGAGEMENT OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL HUMANITIES

Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeology always has been as remains to this day a discipline with legs in both the natural sciences – especially geology – and
the humanities. Notably, there is an ethical movement underway in the geosciences where some are even suggesting a mandatory no-harm ‘ethical promise’ akin to that of medical professionals; all the while, the humanities are undergoing an ‘environmental
turn’, where an increasing number of scholars is arguing strongly for a head-on engagement, scholarly and activist, with contemporary quandaries of climate change. Where does archaeology stand in this? Most previous thinking about archaeological
ethics does not relate to climate change, despite the fact that much archaeological research speaks directly to it. While I reject
the radically prescriptive approach of an ethical promise, climate change is increasingly putting pressure on practitioners, institutions and disciplines to take individual and collective action. While such action may begin at the individual level, our places of
employment (e.g. universities) and our organisations (e.g. the EAA) can act as multipliers of such agency. Ranging from harmless
civil disobedience to working in and with the system, I provide a few examples of how we might bring about such disciplinary
decarbonisation.
