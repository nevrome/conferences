The high-altitude Andes (above 2.500 masl) has been an area classically rejected as a space for the early occupation of South
America because of its extreme environmental conditions, which include cold temperatures and hypoxia. Therefore, most models for the initial peopling of this area propose a later exploration of the highlands, mainly done by logistical parties of hunter-gatherer groups that would first have settled on the coast or in the lowlands.
Contrary to these ideas, this paper presents the study of Cuncaicha (4,480 masl), one of the oldest sites of the Peruvian highlands, and explores the different lines of evidence including faunal, lithic and botanical remains, to show that hunter-gatherer
societies occupied the site as a residential base camp as early as 12,500 years cal BP. We examine the connection between site
function assumptions, which are defined mainly using lithic indicators, and mobility implications presented usually as collector
vs forager strategies and ephemeral vs permanent occupations. Based on the different activities identified in Cuncaicha, and
on the detailed study of the lithic chaines operatoires, we define specific features of this high-altitude Andean early occupation
and suggest a more empirically rigorous approach to interpret site functions. We propose the development of an early human
adaptation in the area and consequently the creation of a human landscape during the Terminal Pleistocene.
