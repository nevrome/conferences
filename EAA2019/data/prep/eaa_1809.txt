Since 2016, an open campsite is excavated in the Austrian Karwendel Mountains, the largest range of the Northern Calcareous
Alps, which is located between the Isar and Inn rivers, at the German-Austrian border. The campsite is situated at an altitude
of 1800 m asl and has yielded fireplaces, stone artefacts and animal bones. The raw materials of the stone artefacts indicate
that the hunters and gatherers using this site either maintained extended exchange networks, ranging from Bavaria to Northern
Italy, or that they travelled themselves over very long distances. Interestingly, the radiocarbon dates suggest that the site was
frequented during the Mesolithic as well as during the Early/Middle Neolithic. This means that a (Post-) Mesolithic lifestyle was
practiced far into the Neolithic period in this area. A pollen analysis from the nearby valley bottom seems to confirm this assumption. So this site constitutes a good example to study both the mobility of hunter-gatherers and the beginning of agropastoral
activities at high altitudes in the Central Alps.
