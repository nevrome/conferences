The last decades have witnessed a vivid discussion of children in archaeology, and they are now being investigated from different perspectives. For the early Iron Ages the natural focus is on burial archaeology, as the early Iron Age features ostentatious
burials of children in different regions. In many cases, children’s graves are/have been regarded as a separate category within
cemetery analysis, but they can provide valuable information about the social framework of the entire burial community, as burial
rituals offer possibilities to negotiate norms and values.
In German-speaking archaeology, discussions of these child burials are dominated by the interpretation that rich burials of subadult individuals indicate the hereditary nature of social status depicted in the burial rituals. As such, these children are linked to
questions of social and political structures and seem to indicate dynastic systems. Naturally this is only one facet of the possible interpretations and explanations of such burials and in this paper we want to discuss different possibilities to interpret rich
child burials of the early Iron Ages beyond inheritance. We will present case studies from Central Europe, Italy and the Balkans to
illustrate the diversity of these burials and the associated discussions.
