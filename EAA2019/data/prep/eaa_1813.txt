individuals (e.g. benefactors), altered the environment, and how buildings and structures have been shaped in their architectural
features to adapt to the local morphology. Alpine regions or other mountain areas highly affect the planning and the arrangement
of cities. The necessity of overcoming relevant natural constraints determined a variety of peculiar architectural choices and
works.
We welcome papers that innovatively explore the position and building technique of structures for public utility (hydraulic structures, defensive systems, entertainment buildings as well as buildings serving religious, administrative and commercial purposes) in Roman cities. A particular emphasis should be given to the construction technique in relation to the physical geography
of mountain areas. For this specific topic it is important to address the reasons why a structure has been built in a particular
location, instead of elsewhere.
Papers can address Alpine regions or other mountainous areas within the limits of the Roman Empire. A round table will follow the
presentations, in order to promote discussion and to identify similarities and differences among the case-studies presented in
the session.
