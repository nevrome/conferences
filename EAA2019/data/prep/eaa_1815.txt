Presentation Format: Oral
Since its first phases, the Umbrian settlement of Ocriculum is established on the top of the hill where the modern city of Otricoli
still remains. This position was useful even to control the port on the Tiber that made the wealth of this little town, together with
the consular road.
The landing was in a river bend 160 m lower and about 1 km west to the city; today the Tiber flows even more to the west and the
port doesnâ€™t exist anymore since mid-19th century. South of its site there is a huge tufaceous plateau, crossed by a little stream
named San Vittore. The latter dug in soft tufa a deep valley up to the Tiber river.
Between the 1st century B.C. and the 1st century AD, the Roman municipium experienced a massive monumentalisation exactly
on the above-mentioned plateau. The regularization works were very impressive and the buildings, still remaining, are suitable for
a very important city: it proves the richness of this city, despite its small size.
Huge vaulted substractions like those of Hellenistic Sanctuaries in Lazio; theatre and amphitheatre leant against and supporting
the tufa slope; a monumental wall (identified as a nympheum) hiding an elaborated system of reservoir and hydraulic structures
that supplied water to the city; last but not least an impressive underground channel in which still flows the San Vittore stream.
All these constructions allowed the creation of a big terraced town along the Tiber valley. Even the port structures had to arrange
themselves on more levels: in fact, there are many archive documents showing how, still in the 18th century, craves and gantries
were designed for carrying products from the landing, at 40 m a.s.l., up to the road to the city, at more than 80 m a.s.l.
