THE HOUSE OF LIVIA ON THE PALATINE HILL: THE ART OF BUILDING’S CONSTRUCTION ON A DOUBLE
SLOPE
Author(s): Torrisi, Valentina (Sorbonne Université)
Presentation Format: Oral
The House of Livia, the emblematic late republican domus located on the Palatine Hill, was constructed over a double incline/
slope from north to south and the north-west to south-east. In this proposal, I offer an analysis of the architectural solutions
used during the House’s construction to resolve issues of ‘dénivellation’ and to adapt building methods to the natural topography of the Hill. The first and most immediately obvious issue facing the construction was the water run off from the top Hill,
circumvented by the digging of substantial canal systems underneath the structure of the domus itself as well as the creation
of multiple cisterns. Only the deeper underground foundations (around 7m) remain of the House of Livia which were treated
differently according to their respective zones (north-west sector containing the painted walls equipped very probably with
‘Bocca di lupo’ windows and the south-east sector with its dual level superimposed foundations). The builders responsible for the
construction of the House of Livia would have too benefitted from the rich experience provided by the frequent usage of artificial
terracing, by that time a commonly implemented feature used by Roman architects for already two centuries.
