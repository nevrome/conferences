This paper focuses on the role of landscape on fortifications built on mountain peaks in the territory of Kosovo. It analyses the
role of the mountains in these structures, in the protection, and in the opportunity to create communication with other fortresses.
Republic of Kosovo is located in southeast Europe, on the Balkan Peninsula. Its routes of civilization go back in the prehistory,
from the Neolithic, Eneolithic, Bronze and Iron Age. In the past, this territory was known as Dardania. After the fall of Dardania
under the Roman Empire, a number of urban towns were developed. In the Late Antiquity (4th – 6th century) due to the different
tribe attacks, the population started to abandon the towns, and relocate in hills and mountains, for better protection. According
to Procopius of Caesarea in ”De Aedificiis”, during the rule of the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great, 61 fortifications were
reconstructed and 8 were constructed in the territory of Dardania.
This paper analyses the link between mountains and fortresses, the natural protection strengthened with human built walls, by
taking as a case study the Fortress of Marec in Kosovo: a Late Antiquity fortress, located on the peak of a hill, 910 meters above
the sea level. The paper will present the archaeological results by so far, since the excavations are still ongoing.
