The relationship between theatres and cities is a topic still to be deepened. Many are, in fact, the aspects that should be considered and above all that each city is characterized by its own history and its urban development.
Starting from the Augustan age the theatre became a symbol of the Roman city. The importance of this monument typology is
underlined also by Vitruvius. He describes this building for spectacula immediately after the description of the forum area, giving
suggestions on its construction.
However, the archaeological reality often doesâ€™nt correspond to the urban model defined by the Roman architect. The main problems are related to the choice of the site where the theatre should be built. There are numerous aspects that determine the
choice of the place of construction. Particular attention should be given to the geo-morphological aspects, to the possibility of
recovering construction material locally, to the availability of water, etc. All these factors were relevant to avoid problems related
also to economic aspects. Specifically in urban settlements included in mountainous landscape, the attention to the geographical element is even more evident.
The analysis on the relationship between theater and city will be developed through some examples of Roman cities in Italy.
