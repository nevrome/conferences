The partial abandonment of traditional urnfields can be observed in large parts of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in the
Middle Iron Age (MIA; c. 525 – 275 BC). While extended urnfields and rich ‘chieftain’ graves dominate the Early Iron Age (EIA; c.
650 – 525 BC), MIA cemeteries become smaller in size whereby graves become less monumental, contain fewer grave goods,
and urns become scarce. The site of Oss-IJsselstraat contained 26 cremation graves that could be dated to the MIA. The majority of the graves contained sherds and/or animal bone (14/20; 70.0%), and four graves yielded an urn. Two graves contained
grave goods that are considered to represent elite status: grave 3 an iron torque and grave 4 a burnt bronze torque and a burnt
iron knife. Both graves were surrounded by square ditches and were positioned against each other in the center of the cemetery.
Osteoarchaeological analysis showed that at least 23 individuals were buried in Oss-IJsselstraat, and that the majority of individuals was adult (19/23; 82.6%). Two non-adult individuals, one aged 4 – 6 years and one aged 7 – 12 years, were buried together
