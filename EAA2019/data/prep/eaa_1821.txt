AROUND DURANCE VALLEY (FRANCE)
Author(s): Raynaud, Karine (APASA) - Gautier, Laure (Aix-Marseille University)
Presentation Format: Poster
This poster present results of field archaelogical projects leaded in southern French Alps on both side of Durance valley and
watertank of Serre-Ponçon.
Used methodology cross together survey, excavations, archives research and aerial views, giving new datas for roman period
in this area. Connection between rural and urban settlement, focused around major Roman routes, is continue from low river
landscapes to high pastures places, including stone quarry points, water management and strategic postitions. But most of all,
soil quality seems to stay a major attractive condition, following housing locations from protohistoric times. Through these new
data obtained in a quite unknow area, roman paradigmes have been given to communities with a good eye on local specificities. If
some of them last in time, others didn’t pass the antiquity period as this landscape can not stay artificial without a strong maintenance. To put a end, this field approach seem how it is necessary to investigate low, median and high places as well, in a way to
understand all components of historical occupations.
