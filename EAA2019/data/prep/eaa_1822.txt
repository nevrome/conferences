The colonia of Augusta Praetoria Salassorum was founded in 25 BC at the top of the Romanization process of the northwestern
Alps, in order to seal the control of some of the most important mountain passes to the transalpine regions. The original layout
of the city, built on the back of a natural basin and along the middle course of the Dora Baltea, provided a rather essential monumental panoply, within a regular urban network of 64 insulae. The most important public complexes of Aosta, concomitant with
the foundation, are the forum, with a sacred area and a platea civica, probably a square with a temple and a quadriporticus, and
the city walls with the four turreted entrances. The supply of lithic material for the construction of the Augustan urban plan
probably required a rather intensive anthropic impact, concentrated near the suburbium of the city: local materials such as a
travertine limestone and a conglomerate traditionally known as “puddinga” were both the object of cultivation in quarries not
far from Aosta. The local bardiglio, a blue-grey marble extracted a few kilometers from the colonia, was the main lithic material
of the Augusta Praetoria “monumentalization” period, in the middle of the first century AD: it was heavily used for structural and
decorative elements in the existing complexes and in the new buildings, such as the thermae, the Theater and the Amphitheater.
