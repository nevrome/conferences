COLLABORATIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELDWORK AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE DIGITAL
WORLD
Theme: Digital archaeology, science and multidisciplinarity: new methods, new challenges
Organisers: Anvari, Jana (Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology, University of Cologne) - Biehl, Peter (Anthropology, University
at Buffalo, State University of New York) - Rosenstock, Eva (Institute for Prehistoric Archaeology, Freie Universit√§t Berlin)
Format: Regular session
Increasingly, archaeological projects are multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional and multi- national collaborations that rely on the
productive exchange of data and ideas between geographically disparate project members. The ever-growing amounts of digital
data they produce necessitate dedicated management and archiving plans, which are handled in very different ways depending
on funding institutions, national or state regulations - despite efforts to develop transnational standards (e.g. ARCHES). Some
projects wish to share some or all their data and results online with a larger audience via social media or online archives. This
requires them not only to find the resources to do so, and to maintain the data, but also to address intellectual property guidelines stipulated by antiquity legislation, involved institutions, funding bodies and publishers. There is also a need to discuss best
practices regarding issues of access to finds and data for future scientific research. This session invites papers that reflect on
the multiple managerial, ethical and legal challenges as well as opportunities involved in organising, archiving and sharing archaeological field data and research results. It welcomes theoretical contributions as well as reports of own work and experiences
