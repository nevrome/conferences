FIELD SCHOOLS IN THE DIGITAL WORLD: A VIEW FROM NORTH AMERICA
Author(s): Boytner, Ran (Institute for Field Research)
Presentation Format: Oral
Field schools have been the mainstay of archaeological praxis for over a century. In North America, most field schools were traditionally organized by universities and took place across the world. Students enrolled through word of mouth or by taking classes
with the field school instructor. But the world of field schools dramatically changed by the digital revolution, especially in North
America. Beginning with Shovelbums.org, later with the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and now with the new American
Anthropological Association (AAA) AnthroGuide, field schools information was put online and students became empowered to
search, explore and enroll to hundreds of programs online. This digital revolution also yielded the birth of academically independent field school organization, utilizing the reach of the digital world and the very low cost of entry to create economies of scale
and offer huge selection and new types of field schools. This paper will explore the history of the digital field school portal and its
dramatic impact on offerings, quality and funding for archaeological research. The collaborative nature of field work will not be
considered here at the level of individual projects but at the level of the entire sector, providing birdâ€™s eye view of trends shaping
the archaeology practice of the future.
