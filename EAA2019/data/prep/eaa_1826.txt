A LEGACY WORTH COLLABORATING WITH/OVER

Material excavated a century ago has no less bearing on the past than newly unearthed data. So archaeology is in the relatively
rare position that century-old data is relevant to our current questions. Of course, today we excavate –and administrate! – to
different standards and with very different questions in mind, but problematically, we cannot re-excavate old data. If we are to
capitalise on archaeology’s extraordinary position of an ever expanding dataset, we need to include these legacy data into our
analyses.
The upshot of this ever expanding mound of data is that it increasingly requires multiple people to effectively collate and analyse
it. Using experience gained while developing an ontological database in the context of the Big Data on the Roman Table research
network as illustration, I will touch on important issues of collaboration (streamlining goals within the project) and usability within
and beyond a particular project. The latter two lead to the importance of flexible tools that will bear adaptation to use disparate
data for different aims and questions. In other words, not only do we need to cooperate within a given project, but ideally also
across projects and time if we are to avoid re-treading the same ground over and over again. In this paper, the tool I will be illustrating these points with will be the ontological database developed for the BDRT research network.
