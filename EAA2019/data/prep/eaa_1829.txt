Presentation Format: Oral
Making archaeological data open and freely accessible is a priority across Europe, but the domain lacks appropriate, persistent
repositories. Due to the fragility of digital data and non-repeatable nature of most archaeological research, archaeology is poised
to lose a generation of research to the Digital Dark Age. The key to mitigating this crisis is to bring archaeologists and data
management specialists together to share expertise, and create resources that allow them to address problems in the most
appropriate way within their own countries. While important international standards exist and should be used, there is no single
way to build a repository. To be successful, archaeologists must be at the decision-making heart of how their data is archived
to ensure re-use is possible. This paper will introduce the newly funded COST Action SEADDA (Saving European Archaeology
from the Digital Dark Age) which will work to create a priority research network on the archiving, dissemination and open access
re-use of archaeological data, and includes participation from over 30 countries. SEADDA brings together an interdisciplinary
network of archaeologists and computer scientists; experts in archaeological data management and open data dissemination
and re-use. SEADDA will allow archaeologists from countries with archiving expertise to work with archaeologists with few or no
available options, so they may share knowledge, create dialogue within their countries, and move forward to address the crisis.
This paper will also discuss ways in which EAA members can participate and benefit from the Action.
