The field of ancient DNA has made a profound impact on the field of archaeology, and the ever-increasing production of DNA
data, as well as the emergence of “genomics factory” laboratories, is a divisive subject in archaeology (Lewis-Kraus 2019). One
issue in this divide surrounds how genomics data should be archived and distributed; who owns this data, and how can it be made
accessible (or should it be made accessible) for multiple, differing interest groups? This paper articulates some of the approaches that the field of biomolecular archaeology utilizes to archive and access data, and reflects on some of the challenges in this
archiving and distribution, especially with regards to communication with colleagues in adjacent disciplines and different interest groups. In the experiences of the author, while there is a general willingness to make raw data available, alienation between
different research groups can arise due to a lack of mutual understanding or appreciation about terminologies or jargon, differing
approaches to research conduct, and what is deemed a productive research output in different academic environments. Moreover, such raw biomolecular data may only be of use, at least at present, to other groups working with similar data types, and who
have the financial and computational capacity to re-analyse such data. Fundamentally, data archiving should not simply be a “tick
box” exercise, and is a research step that requires forethought, careful consideration of different interest groups and flexibility.
