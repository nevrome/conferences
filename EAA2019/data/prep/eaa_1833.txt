IsoMemo (http://www.isomemo.com) is a Big Data initiative bringing together several repositories of isotopic data from various
research fields including archaeology. IsoMemo follows a partnership-based model in which autonomous repositories are responsible for defining metadata and collecting data according to specific research needs. Within archaeological research this
implies that repositories select data for collection according to cultural, geographical, and chronological criteria.
The IsoMemo initiative promotes the production and open access to isotopic data and the development of new databases having
developed the concept of source recognition for both data producers and compilers. It also coordinates data collection among
partners and develops open access tools for data search and data mirroring to ensure its long-term accessibility.
Another major feature of IsoMemo is the development of new statistical tools for the analysis of Big isotopic Data and data
integration of isotopic and non-isotopic datasets leading to the development of large-scale interdisciplinary projects. In this paper, the IsoMemo organizational model will be described and several examples will be presented to illustrate the archaeological
potential of the initiative.
