Institute Labrys, o.p.s. was founded in 2007 and it primarily focuses on rescue archaeological excavations. From the beginning
we are striving for a gradual transition from paper to digital documentation used in field excavations. We have tried a number
of workflows and technologies in field documentation over the past 12 years. Some of them have worked well, some of them
required gradual modifications, and another have been rejected.
Currently the most important tasks for our research are: intersectional photogrammetry, geodetic measurement using the
GNSS technology, and online database of stratigraphic units, including records of research documentation units (tranches, sections etc.).
The main requirements for digital technology in archaeological excavation are: easy and efficient data collection, spatial identification, clarity and unity of rules and data formats above all. The goal of this documentation workflow is possibility of easy
sharing of data while processing and evaluating. And of course cost savings during field works and data postprocessing. The big
advantage is, that data do not have to be transcripted and also there works automatic duplicate control above all.
While this is a very tempting technological progress, we are facing a number of obstacles such as unwillingness to accept new
technologies. And there are also many various non-standard technologies and data formats used by individual archaeological
companies. And last but not least the problem is also the willingness of workers to learn to new workflows.
We are currently testing “ArcheoPteryx“ information system, which is used for online data collection in the field during our large
scale rescue excavation with using tablets, GNSS kit and also photography and photogrammetry sets.
