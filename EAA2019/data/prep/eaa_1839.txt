however, they are sometimes shaped like vessels and are therefore difficult to identify. The database makes it easier to compare the different types of fragments from different sites, so that we can analyse them with a broader perspective. Changes in
chronology and types, of course, are also more readily analysed by this database.
This database currently runs on ready-made software (FileMaker Pro, FileMaker International) and is used in a very limited setting: the archaeology of ancient Palestine, especially in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, characterized by acculturation of
foreign styles. We need a broader analysis of pottery fragments, not only in Israel or Palestine but also in areas such as southern
Europe, as one of the regions of Jewish diaspora. I hope that further studies will extend the unified database for use on a broader
range of mutual research.
