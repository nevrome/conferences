CHALLENGING CHANGE: PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL COLLABORATION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Corns, Anthony (The Discovery Programme; CHERISH) - Dawson, Tom (University of St Andrews; SCAPE) - Marshall, Sinead (CITiZAN; MOLA)
Format: Regular session
Climate change impacts including: rising sea levels, more rainfall and increases in storm intensity and frequency, are creating
challenges for the historic environment. With rates of change set to accelerate in the future, the time to act on these current and
future threats is one of the most pressing challenges for the archaeological and wider community. To successfully understand
and adapt to these threats, a truly cross disciplinary and integrated horizontal approach is required bringing together researchers from archaeology, geography, remote sensing, oceanography, history, planning and other domains. In addition, to effectively
resolve these issues researchers must ensure that the full range of vertical societal actors are included in meaningful cooperation: from the macro level of government policy development to the active citizen scientist.
This session invites papers which explore the range of approaches taken within current archaeology projects and heritage management strategies which are going someway to observe, understand and analyse these complex horizontal and vertical issues
with the aim of identifying the most appropriate mitigation and adaption strategies at the national, regional and local level.
