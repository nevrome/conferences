and non-participatory methodologies. Therefore, by drawing on a value-based heritage conservation paradigm this paper puts
forward the following main question; how can the adaptive capacity of cultural heritage and its associative cultural significance
be strengthened in the context of climate change associated impacts?. To operationalize question, a deductive approach was
taken via a detailed site based case study findings.
Thus, given the socio-cultural context of the case study - Louroujina village, Cyprus - this study suggests two social categories
and ten sets of indicators for the adaptive capacity of cultural heritage in events of climate change impacts. To operationalize
the suggested indicators, this study assigns values to them through the application of Delphi technique and analytical hierarchy
processing (AHP) methods which targets three main actors: the State of the one hand (the municipality and the Department of
Antiquity), community members and the academic researchers on the other hand. To this end, this research posits a participatory procedure that can be easily replicated in a variety of local contexts for the operationalization of cultural heritage adaptive
capacity in event of climate change impacts.
