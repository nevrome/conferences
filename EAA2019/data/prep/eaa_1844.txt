Presentation Format: Oral
The long, sandy western coast of the Outer Hebrides is home to thousands of remarkable archaeological sites. Many are remarkably well-preserved, having been buried under metres of wind-blown sand and thus protected from stone-robbers and exposure
to the elements. However, this shoreline is exposed to the full brunt of Atlantic storms; and when the raging sea hits the dunes
and delicate machair, the change can be devastating. Tens of metres of land can be lost at a time, with the sea sucking away the
sand and the archaeological layers contained within. Although climate change predictions suggest that this is a problem that
will worsen in the future, the effects are already being seen, with damage on a huge scale being done to heritage sites. With
reference to some of the archaeological work done in response to the threat posed to heritage by nature, this talk will explore
what members of the Hebridean community think of these changes, something that they have lived with all their lives. The talk
will include a film featuring interviews with local residents against a backdrop of the stunning scenery. They will discuss how the
coast has changed in the past, and what they expect for the future.
