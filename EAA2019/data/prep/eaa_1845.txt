CHERISH (Climate, Heritage and Environments of Reefs, Islands and Headlands) is a five-year Ireland-Wales project, bringing
together four partners across two nations: the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales; the Discovery Programme, Ireland; Aberystwyth University: Department of Geography and Earth Sciences; and Geological Survey Ireland.
It began in January 2017 and will run until December 2021; it will receive €4.1 million of EU funds through the Ireland Wales
Co-operation Programme 2014–2020.
The project collaborates with agencies, stakeholders, landowners and local groups to identify our joint-nation working areas.
These have been selected on the basis of knowledge and data gaps (particularly islands and remote headlands), priority areas of
erosion risk or where there is potential to collaborate on survey work.
The project is currently at the half way stage of its five year funding programme. This paper will summarize the outputs and accomplishments of the project to date, including:
•
Completion of the first stage baseline recording and vulnerability assessment of the archaeological indicator sites
•
Integration of multi temporal and multi modal recording strategies in the monitoring of the historic environment
•
Research and development or rapid remote sensing methodologies to identify the full archaeological extent of monuments and the historic environment at risk from climate change
•
Development of outreach and community engagement activities to develop a lasting legacy once the project ends
•
Exploration of indicator wreck survey methodologies and preliminary results.
•
Integration of research results within Government strategies and policy.
•
The archiving and promotion of project data for wider use and long term monitoring.
