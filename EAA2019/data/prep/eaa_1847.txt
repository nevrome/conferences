sustainable fisheries and potential oil and gas exploitation in the Barents Sea give reason for additional concern. Under the terms
of the Svalbard Treaty Norway is responsible for managing the archipelago. This obligation has been amplified and repeated
through various international conventions and agreements, such as the UNESCO Convention concerning the protection of the
world’s cultural and natural heritage. The Norwegian government has set the goal that Svalbard should be one of the best-managed wilderness areas in the world – including historic remains in the definition of wilderness.
The Svalbard archipelago houses more than two thousand historic sites. Most of them situated close to the shoreline, heavily
influenced by several kinds of geothreats, whereas coastal erosion is one of them.
To implement an integrated and comprehensive approach to meet the challenge of managing the effects of climate change this
paper assess future challenges and discuss the sustainability in today’s management of Svalbard’s historical remains. This is
done by means of interviews, arcive studies and field work. The results indicates that there is a substantial need to develop
methods that will allow the documentation of natural hazard risk for cultural heritage to be quantified and to be met by sustainable management. Potential management actions are discussed in the paper.
