THE RAMIFICATIONS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE: MEETING THE CHALLENGES FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE
CONSERVATION

Presentation Format: Oral
Understanding and adapting to climatic change requires considering a broad range of effects. Phenomena such as altered ocean
composition and coastline configuration, drought and precipitation patterns, among other environmental disruptions, stimulate significant additional alterations and challenges. As already evident, the ramifications of climate change include population migration on local, regional and international scale, conflict stimulated by scarce natural and financial resources, as well as
erosion of governmental stability and authority. What are the implications for archaeology and cultural heritage management?
How should we respond given the rapidity and severity of the threats we now perceive? Where do we find examples of actions to
augment and conserve evidence of the past under such circumstances? Considering this broader context should provide further
insight into threats and challenges while suggesting more effective means of protecting archaeological material and cultural
heritage in general both in the present and the future. Several exemplary projects and activities point the way, as they illustrate
how vastly underutilized resources - human and technological - can be enlisted. Meeting the challenges ahead may require adjusting deep-seated attitudes and conventions held by cultural heritage professionals.
