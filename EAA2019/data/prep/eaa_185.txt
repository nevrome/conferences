INFANTS IN WELLS AT ERETRIA, EUBOIA AND THE ATHENIAN AGORA: DEVIANT OR NORMATIVE BURIAL
PRACTICE?

The deposition of bodies in abandoned wells has often been considered a deviant burial practice, yet it is a common finding in
excavations across the Greek world. Large numbers of infant remains in wells have in the past been viewed as potential evidence
of troubling practices such as infanticide or human sacrifice. However recent publications of wells in the Athenian Agora (Liston, Rotroff, and Snyder 2018) and Messene (Bourbou and Themelis 2010) suggest that these sensational interpretations are
unlikely and natural infant deaths should be considered in most cases. Recent analyses of human remains from wells in Eretria,
Euboia suggests that this burial practice is more common than has been recognized. A well excavated in 2016-2017 contains at
least fifty infant remains deposited in the Late Roman period. Here again, the age profiles and evidence of pathology suggest the
deaths of many of the infants are from natural causes. At least two additional wells in the Athenian Agora and one in Eretria have
smaller numbers of infant skeletons too. In at least three of Agora and Eretria wells, large numbers of dog skeletons intermixed
with the infant bones indicate that sacrifices probably accompanied the deposition of the infant bodies, or were conducted in
the same location, suggesting some sort of ritual behaviour, not simply expedient disposal of the dead. The evidence suggests
that depositions in wells were a common method of burial for infants who died at or near the time of birth, and the practice should
perhaps be considered a normative, if perhaps somewhat marginalized, process, rather than deviant behaviour.
