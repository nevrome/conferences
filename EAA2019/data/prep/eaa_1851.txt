the debates on climate change and archaeological heritage; the second is to present a first theoretical and methodological
proposal on the development of qualitative and quantitative indicators of vulnerability for the archaeological heritage of the
coastland of the North Coast of São Paulo, Brazil. In recent years, in the specific case of Brazil, what we define historical-cultural
and natural heritage has been devastated by socio-environmental disasters. We can mention: the floods in São Luiz do Paraitinga
in 2010, the disasters generated by Samarco in Mariana in 2015, the fire in the National Museum in 2018, and by the Vale do Rio
Doce in Brumadinho in the year 2019. So far, we hadn’t faced the challenge of thinking about metrics for the vulnerability of the
Brazilian archaeological heritage and resulting plans for the integrated management of this patrimony. Thereby, our proposal is to
analyze the archaeological patrimony of the north coast of São Paulo as a case study that can be extended to any national scenario. The region has a significant extension of its territory delimited as an area of environmental protection, rich in biodiversity,
and has been shown vulnerable to multiple urban pressures and new forms of economic exploitation. The contrasts generated by
the context of risk have marked the lives of local residents and, in the same context, the very integrity of the local archaeological
heritage. The proposal to participate in this Session 325. Challenging Change is linked to our need for dialogue and theoretical
and methodological exchanges in the field of archaeological heritage and climate change.
