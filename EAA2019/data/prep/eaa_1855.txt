CITIZAN’S COASTAL PERSPECTIVE: TOWARDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF
CLIMATE CHANGE

Presentation Format: Oral
Since its foundation in 2015 the CITiZAN community archaeology project’s focus has been training volunteers in practical skills
to assist with the mammoth task of recording and monitoring English coastal and intertidal archaeological sites, which are under
threat from extreme erosion and climate change.
We present our approach for the next three-year programme, 2019 -2022, building on established networks and systems to
focus on six new CITiZAN Discovery Programme areas: the Humber, Liverpool Bay, the Blackwater, the Kent coast, the Solent and
Devon.
With funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund (formerly HLF) and support from MOLA, the Council for British Archaeology
and the Nautical Archaeology Society, we are further developing horizontal and vertical working relationships with a range of
local, regional and national stakeholders to achieve these aims. Landowners, wardens and others with established relationships
to these stretches of coast are joining the effort. Targeted professional development training from CITiZAN staff will assist
these contributors to recognise and deal with threatened archaeology in their local Discovery Programme area as a vital part of
the team’s work.
How might such a collaborative approach help us to better understand the impact of climate change on this vulnerable archaeological resource?
