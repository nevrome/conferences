nologies to allow “down-scaling” from the large scale regional level, moving on to the local site level and finally to the individual
components of a site; “upscaling”. The project looked at six scientific themes to address the successful management of underwater cultural heritage:
•
Geological models for regional evaluation of probability of locating archaeological sites and their preservation potential
•
Development of Tools for Surveying and Monitoring Coastal and Underwater Archaeological Sites
•
Assessing the burial environment and deterioration of organic materials
•
Assessment of the state of preservation of waterlogged archaeological wood
•
Tools and techniques to raise waterlogged organic archaeological artefacts
•
In situ stabilisation of underwater archaeological sites
An overview of the results will be given and the implications of the results in terms of how such research projects could be better
incorporated in marine spatial planning will be discussed.
