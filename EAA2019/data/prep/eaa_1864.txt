UNESCO estimate that there are over three million shipwrecks lying on the bottom of the world’s seas and oceans. International
(UNESCO, 2001; ICOMOS, 1996) and European (Valletta, 1992) legislation all advocate that underwater cultural heritage should,
where possible, be protected in situ. However, such legislation cannot protect underwater cultural heritage from the potential
ravages of nature. Since their time of sinking, shipwrecks will be exposed to a multitude of physical, chemical and biological
processes, as well as cultural impacts that will affect their preservation. It is thus essential to be able to assess the effect the
natural environment has had and will have on shipwrecks in the future should they be preserved in situ. This paper will present an
ongoing project to investigate the preservation of wrecks in the North sea. The project draws on an unprecedented multibeam
echosounder dataset of over 400 wrecks. The ultimate goal of the project is to correlate the observed seabed distribution of
these wrecks with natural and cultural formation processes in a GIS platform in order to better understand the deterioration of
shipwrecks and facilitate the future preservation and management of this resource.
