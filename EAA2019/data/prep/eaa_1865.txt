UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY IN ESTONIA - WHERE DO WE STAND?
Author(s): Roio, Maili (National Heritage Board of Estonia)
Presentation Format: Oral
After the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, the work with reorganising the legislation and protection of cultural
heritage was started. There were practically no underwater archaeological surveys carried out, there were only three underwater
monuments that were placed under state protection and the so called opening of the sea meant that the known wrecks suffered
a wave of looting.
It was only in 2011, when the Heritage Conservation Act enabled to expand specific protection to underwater heritage and the
links with other relevant legal acts began to form about the same time. The change of attitude among the general public has
moved hand in hand with the regulations. The development of underwater archaeology as a discipline in the last couple of decades has helped balance the backlog from the rest of Europe that was evident in the 1990s.
A major emphasis in underwater archaeological surveys is placed on non-destructive methods and inventory of antiquities,
which due to the development of 3D softwares has remarkably shortened the time it takes to carry out fieldwork. The topical
issues next to heritage management and maritime spatial planning are, for example, the 20th century wrecks that pose an environmental threat - their inventory and evaluation of risks; establishment of underwater wreck parks which aim to facilitate
accessibility, but also to ensure sustainable management of the sites; depositing large underwater finds (mostly shipwrecks)
that cannot be preserved in their original location etc. In the presentation I will introduce the main directions in the management
of underwater heritage and the results of major processes.
