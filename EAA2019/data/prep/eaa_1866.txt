Underwater investigations of the Stone Age sites located in NW Russia were started in the 1980s by the North-Western archaeological expedition of the State Hermitage Museum. This long-term research remains the only one exploring submerged Stone
Age sites in Russia. Methods of excavation and conservation have been developed and approved through long term researches.
Underwater excavations were conducted mainly on Serteya II site, located on the Serteyka River, the left-tributary of the Western Dvina River, and groups of sites Dubokray located in the lake Sennitsa. On the site Serteya II several dwellings were excavated
thoroughly, which revealed an impressive archive of ecofacts and artefacts survived. Remote sensing methods applied allowed
uncovering new types of sites not known before. Underwater researches were applied for different conditions â€“ sites located
within zero and low visibility milieu, close and remote from the shore, with the variety of constructions and artefacts to be recorded and conserved. Long-term conservation of finds led to establishing and verifications of different methods of field and
museum conservation. Also anthropogenic and natural influences were detected that led to the destruction of some of the sites
that raise the question of possible manners for preservation and recording of such types of the sites.
