being due to the soft sediments accumulated immediately after inundation. Not surprisingly the excavators chose to hone their
new skills by returning to the same sites year after year, in this way getting familiar with the environment and recording methods.
But after the initial projects ended the much-acclaimed new field waned, and not many new sites were excavated to any greater
extent.
Public interest in the new kind of sites on the sea bed was great, and many new sites were reported to the museums, in turn
making their way into the central Sites & Monuments database, but they were taken at face value, and no scrutiny done before
entering into the records. In this way the many hundreds of submerged Stone Age sites each represented by a dot on the map are
unevenly categorised to the point of uselessness.
During the 1980’s a model for locating submerged sites on the basis of underwater topography was developed and has since
proved very efficient. There are however reasons to criticise the uniform use of this model, and suggestions to renewed recon¬naissance are put forward. The treasure trove Danish archaeology has been keen to advertise, is primarily based on less than a
handful of sites, and the true value of it is not well known.
