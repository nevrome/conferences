UNDERWATER HERITAGE IN COLOMBIA: THE SAN JOSÉ GALLEON AFFAIR
Author(s): Piazzini, Carlo (Universidad de Antioquia; University Network of Underwater Cultura Heritage)
Presentation Format: Oral
The previous government of Colombia announced in 2015 the discovery of archaeological remains that could correspond to
the Galleon San José, a royal ship of the Fleet of the Indies sunk in battle in the Caribbean Sea in 1708. The discovery was made
in the context of a project hired with a private company. This contract allows the company to extract and commercialize the
cargo of the Galleon that rises a huge economic value. As this presentation will explain, this action puts at risk the underwater
cultural heritage and goes against the policies that the Colombian State has been developing for decades for the protection of
archaeological heritage. Amid criticism and pressure from different national and international sectors, the current government
has temporarily suspended the extraction process, delaying a decision that would have a high impact on the preservation of the
underwater cultural heritage, and on the development and implementation of national and international policies devoted to its
protection.
