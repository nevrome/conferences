Presentation Format: Oral
During Antiquity, and more particularly the Roman period, the specificities of funeral practices related to the death of children are
extensively documented, especially for the youngest, i.e. those who died before one year old. Indeed, under the term “child” are
grouped together distinct realities in which are associated the very young child who does not yet have a societal identity and the
biological immature who has the status of a social adult.
Whether it is the ancient discoveries or the recent excavations, Avaricum (Bourges, France) has so far delivered a large corpus of
burials of children dated from the early Roman Empire at the end of late Antiquity. Although those burials respect the localisation
and organization characteristics usually recognized in Roman Gaul, it nevertheless underlines the diversity of gestures devoted
to children. From graves in domestic settings, outside community graveyards, to sarcophagus burials inside funerary buildings
settle in the main urban necropolis, the contexts of discovery and the organization of burials vary significantly in time and space.
Beyond funerary perspectives, data from forensic archaeology put into perspective with historical sources indicate that those
developments keep pace of structural, social and ideological transformations known from the 1st to the end of the 5th century
in the capital of Biturigi Cubii. Based on various significant examples, this presentation will focus on illustrating those changes,
which are directly related to the place it occurs, rural area or urban area, to the populations that carry it out and the context in
which it take place.
