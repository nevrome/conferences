Water mills in Czechia and Poland start to begin in the XII century. The process of increasing the number of water mills and
their development is well reflected in historical documents, but there are still small number of examples of archaeologically
researched mills in both country. This study presents the state of archaeological research of medieval water mills in Czechia and
Poland and the result of comparative analysis of them. The analysis is based on the archaeological research of sixteen sites: ten
of them are located in Czechia, six in Poland. The following elements from this sample have been analyzed: mill structure with its
construction, functions, environmental changes and artifacts found on the archaeological sites.
The result of comparative analysis shows the mill as a complex of buildings for different purposes connected to the environment
that has been changed for milling aims. The examination of artifacts shows the additional tasks in which the miller took part. The
results suggest that future archaeological research can provide new data on such milling aspects.
