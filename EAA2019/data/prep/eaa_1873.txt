APPROACHING HIGH AND LATE MEDIEVAL URBAN ELITES â€“ A JIGSAW OF DIFFERENT BOXES
Author(s): Radohs, Luisa (Aarhus University)
Presentation Format: Oral
The present paper provides an overview of my PhD project on urban elites in the southwestern Baltic (12th to 14th centuries).
Heart of my research forms the question of a social differentiation in towns. Urban deposits with their thick cultural layers and
complex stratigraphy allow us unique insights into the living situation, the everyday life and the social practices of the urban
inhabitants through time. However, due to the nature of the archaeological record and the palimpsest-like character of towns,
many difficulties are connected to a social classification of townspeople. Here, questions of precise dating of structures, the
diachronic development of urban plots together with the assignment of archaeological material to specific locations and inhabitants as well as the general question of quantity, quality and the value of material culture must be named. In this regard, a
source-critical approach as well as a holistic and deliberate use of different sort of sources is indispensable.
With my presentation, I will introduce my PhD project on medieval elite groups in North German and Danish towns, highlight key
challenges in my research and present some of my ideas how to approach urban leading groups in order to grasp more of their
specific character. The presentation would like to encourage a subsequent discussion on the potential, but also limitations of
the archaeological and historical record for questions regarding social conditions in high and late medieval times.
