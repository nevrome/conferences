We present preliminary results from an ongoing, large-scale excavation in the medieval harbour of Oslo. We will document the
progression of the harbour front over an estimated period of about 200 years, with associated finds of vessels and shipwrecks.
Continuous development of the harbour was forced by isostatic land rise, gradually lifting older elements towards shallower
water and eventually onto dry land. The mainly horizontal expansion process creates a unique opportunity for archaeological
excavation, and makes the harbour an important proxy for the development of the medieval city itself.
Earlier findings indicate that the time span covered will be mainly late medieval. This will present an opportunity to study the period in the wake of the Black Death, and hopefully gain new insights into the extent and recovery process of the disaster. Changes
in marine technology will likely also be evident, since preliminary investigations indicate the presence of several shipwrecks. The
material culture of the late medieval period is likewise rarely preserved in Oslo, but marine deposits in this area often present very
good conditions for preservation.
The excavation will be conducted during summer/autumn 2019, and cover a substantial proportion of the sea front from ca AD
1350 and up until the 17th century. The results will be processed as 3D models and the excavated areas will be composited continuously as the excavation proceeds. The excavation aims to utilise new methods both for scientific results and public outreach.
