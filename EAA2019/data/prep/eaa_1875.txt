Presentation Format: Oral
Buckles, brooches, buttons... in other words dress accessories - are the best preserved archaeological relics of fashion, and thus
constitute one of the better sources for research on luxury or social status.
Dress accessories have been on the margins of sholarly interests of archaeologists for a long time, but in recent years we have
been observing, the so-called material turn, ie a shift towards studying broadly understood material culture, where the emphasis
is on issues such as assemblages, non-human agency, social status, identity or commodification and consumption of objects. In
addition, we also observe an increased inflow of sources caused by publishing by the so-called ‘detectorists’ (amateur seekers
using metal detectors) of their finds in various internet databases, the largest and oldest of which is managed by the British
Musuem Portable Antiquity Scheme (finds.org).
The aim of this presentation is to discuss currently running project related to the broadly understood consumption of dress
accessories and their usefulness in social communication processes based on archaeological finds from Central Europe at the
broad European comparative background.
