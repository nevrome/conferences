OBJECTS

Although amuletic interpretations were a feature of antiquarian interpretations of burial offerings, they have continued to feature in early medieval British burial reports. Likewise, French- and German-language scholarship has also continued to categorise
certain objects as ‘amuletic’ based on their ascribed attractiveness, material composition, non-function, symbolism, portability,
and antiquity. These long-standing interpretations of mortuary objects have little to do with early medieval amulets and limit our
comprehension of early medieval funerary practices.
This new approach, inspired by assemblage theory and previous early medieval mortuary spatial research, offers a different
understanding of the mortuary context in early medieval Western Europe. Utilising material from Kent, East Anglia, and Alsace,
my research interprets all objects within inhumations not as static entities but as entities with dynamic and fluid identities and
meanings that change with time to suit specific needs in different locations. This approach stresses that mortuary objects’
identities are formed through immediate and distant relations and must be understood within their spatial positioning, associated burial structures, the accompanying corpse, and pathology.
