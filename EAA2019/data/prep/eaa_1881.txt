Presentation Format: Oral
This paper will discuss the first steps of a postdoctoral project which explores new approaches to the transformation of sacred space in early medieval north-western Europe. This project explores the natural physical definition and development of
sacred places in north-western Europe between the 5th and the 12th centuries AD. This broad chronology encompasses the
main three stages of conversion to Christianity (mission, diffusion and institutionalisation). A comparative approach drawing
on case studies from Brittany, Scotland, Ireland and Scandinavia provides new understandings of the structure and agency of
sacred space in this key period. By bringing together data from a wide geographical spectrum throughout north-western Europe,
the project presented here examines the process of inecclesiamento at a large scale, in area that were engaged in the process
of Christianisation at diverse time periods, during varied lengths of time, to delineate a nuanced and inclusive narrative of the
Christianisation process from a spatial point of view.
