The discovery of two mass graves in Palace Green Library in Durham, UK (2013), led to comprehensive investigations to identify
the buried individuals. It was proposed that the individuals could represent the Scottish soldier prisoners from the Battle of Dunbar in 1650. Multidisciplinary research of the remains supported the hypothesis. Based on an isotope analysis a likely Scottish,
English or migrated origin was proposed for the 13 individuals tested. A preliminary research suggested a good biomolecular
preservation level for one individual, but the overall biomolecular preservation was not known.
This study revisited the Scottish Soldier research material to investigate the preservation of endogenous mitochondrial DNA
of the previously studied 13 individuals. The mitochondrial ancestry and possible geographical origin in relation to the previous
isotope results could be assessed based on DNA analyses. The results included successfully extracted mitochondrial DNA for all
13 sampled individuals. The mitochondrial haplogroup data obtained indicated a western European ancestry and the statistical
analyses showed a continuous pattern of genetic similarity between the individuals and Scotland or England. The lower discrimination level of mitochondrial DNA in the European context and the shortness of the targeted region complicated the analysis
of the geographical origin, but it could be concluded that some individuals displayed Scottish rather than English origin. The
promising results indicated that further ancient DNA analyses could be completed with the material, for example emphasising
Y-chromosome research.
