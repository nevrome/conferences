REACHES OF EMPIRE: HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY AND NEW - GLOBAL - INSIGHTS INTO EUROPEAN
EXPANSION
Theme: Global change and archaeology
Organisers: Seetah, Krish (Stanford University) - Čaval, Saša (Reading Univeristy) - Haines, Julia (University of Virginia)
Format: Session with keynote presentation and discussion
Using ‘Europeanization’ as a framing device, this session will illustrate the increasing global reach of historical archaeology, and
the ways in which the archaeology of the more recent past can shed light on the nuances of social, economic, and ecological
transformation.
Taking a broad and encompassing view of historical archaeology, it is apparent that as a sub-discipline, approach, and conceptual
framework, this sub-discipline continues to flourish, tackling the complexity of working across both material and textual sources
of evidence. This session requests submissions that offer one or more of the following: new insights on the archaeology of the
colonial experience; innovation in methods that push the boundaries of how we study ‘historical archaeology’, or theoretical
positions that offer fertile ground for debate.
Presentations and discussion will emphasize, though not be limited to: assessing the state-of-the-field; how new technologies
as well as connections to other disciplines are contributing to the development of this sub-discipline; observing how approaches to studying historical archaeology are evolving in different parts of the world, whilst questioning how we can learn from and
complement each other?
However, ultimately, with increasing challenges to contemporary populations, it is hoped that papers will centralize on one issue
in particular: how can the archaeology of the recent past help us to understand, moderate, and even mitigate, the negative legacies of colonialism for people and environments?
