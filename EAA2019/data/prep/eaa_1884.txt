During late medieval and colonial period, the disease ecologies of entire regions were transformed due to migrations and human
impact on the land, leading to large-scale debilitating epidemics. In response, European powers completely reimagined regional
landscapes and seascapes adhering to how they perceived epidemic disease and its control. Quarantine, traditionally viewed as
merely a mechanism for the control of disease, became increasingly recognised as a critical feature of Europeanization: the outward material response to important changes taking place socially, ecologically, and politically at the time. This practice of enforced isolation, conceptually and as a system, serves as a lens on changing views towards labour diaspora: the need to protect
populations, both elite and labouring class; and on a political level the assertion of the nation-states’ authority and territoriality.
This paper aims to present preliminary results of the research on Flat Island (Mauritius). This quarantine station in the Indian
Ocean was established by the British Empire to prevent the epidemic of cholera during the second half of the 19th century. Studied archival documents allow a reconstruction of the development and use of this station and bring new information regarding
the transportation and migration routes in the 19th and the 20th century Indian Ocean World.
