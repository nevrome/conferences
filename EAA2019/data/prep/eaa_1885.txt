This paper focuses on migrant laborers in Mauritius, extending scholarship in comparative plantation archaeology through attention to the post-slavery period of the Indian Ocean context. As a British Colony, indentured laborers hailing primarily from
India, and secondarily from China and Africa migrated to Mauritius to replace enslaved labor on sugar plantations beginning in the
1820s and ‘30s. Archaeological and archival fieldwork conducted at Bras d’Eau National Park, located on the N.E. coast of Mauritius, demonstrates how migrant laborers transformed the local cultural and ecological environment. Bras d’Eau was a working
farm with a small enslaved population that transitioned to a sugar plantation during the first quarter of the 19th century, eventually employing hundreds of contract laborers. Despite their short five-year tenures on the plantation, archaeological remains
show that indentured laborers created homes that reflected and recursively structured their worldview even within the confines
of the plantation living quarter, thus challenging perceptions of the impermanence of migrant labor and migrants’ unconcern
with circumstances seen as momentary. Spatial analysis and material culture suggesting that in their every day lives immigrant
men, women, and children expressed an engagement with Indian Ocean notions of health and environment, forming a distinctly
Mauritian cultural milieu of domesticity. This project is a case study for comparative plantation archaeology and colonialism more
broadly, and the growing literature on the materiality of migrant labor.
