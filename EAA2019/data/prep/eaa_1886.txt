The island of Mauritius saw a massive demographic and ecological reconfiguration three times in the past: first when an unpopulated island was settled by the Dutch in 1598. They abandoned the island in 1710, and (2) a few years later the French took it,
imported large numbers of slaves, mainly from Africa and initiate a sugarcane plantation economy. The third change was from
the 1830s on, with the rapid influx of some half-million indentured labourers, predominantly from India, which were brought in to
replace slaves after abolition, and the intensification of sugar cane industry. When emigrating to Mauritius, the settlers brought
their religious beliefs and practices, which have been essential for people adapting to, and reorganizing their domestic and public
lives. In a new environment, the idea of a congregation became very meaningful and had been central to the creation of a community(s).
This paper draws on the complexity of everyday spiritual practices and religious negotiations with the society at large of all
inhabitants of Mauritius, European colonizers, both French and British, and African, Indian and Chinese slaves and indentured
workers, during the colonial period. The standing position of separate groups varied, however individuals and communities endeavoured to position themselves within a multi-religious, but essentially displaced society. A few locations offer the rich tapestry of sacred structures and religious topography as seen on the island, which is at the same time fundamentally connected and
deeply contrasted to the indistinct sugarcane that blankets the terrain.
