In the seventh century, the construction of Buddhist temples became the symbol of authority, replacing the construction of
giant mounded tombs. By this time, Japan grew to be a mature state, having adopted the Chinese-style bureaucracy. Yet, the
introduction of Buddhist temples to various local regions of Japan was very regionally distinctive. In a few regions, construction
of a Buddhist temple took place right after the completion of the newest square mounded tomb. In other regions, Buddhist temples were constructed for the first time toward the end of the seventh century or even in the eighth century, some or long time
after the newest square mounded tomb was constructed. Based on this strong regional difference, the author intends to argue
that, even in the seventh century when the Japanese society seems to have evolved to a centralized state, some local polities
remained somewhat autonomous and independent from the central polity.
