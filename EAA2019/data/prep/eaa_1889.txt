The paper examines in detail the putative, documented, and computer-modeled environmental effects of the transition, in the
Port of Tangier (Morocco, Strait of Gibraltar), from initial Portuguese occupation in 1471 to the English attempts to create a
modern naval base after 1662, to the aftereffects of the demolition in 1683-4 (English evacuation) and to the re-establishment
of Moroccan control. The research constitutes an expansion module to the as yet unreleased revised and augmented “Pre-Modern Tangier (the Médina and Micro-Regional Context) Dataset Ver. 2.1”. The analysis focuses on the hydrographic impact of the
first Portuguese jetty and breakwater in the “Old Port”, on the characteristics and environmental impact of the English “Mole”
breakwater (including the impact of local stone quarrying), on the likely impact of the Portuguese and then English management
of underground water conduits and sewage facilities, and on conclusions to be drawn from the English attempts to maintain, improve, and re-engineer water supply facilities for English warships. The paper presents an augmented and improved bathymetric
DTM of the Old Port of Tangier, with improved estimates of the location, scope, and likely sedimentation impact of the harbor
works, together with an analysis of the processes attendant on their demolition, the natural degradation of the vestiges, and the
partial reuse of those medieval and early modern vestiges for proposed, realized, and shelved colonial harbor works and projects
between 1905 and 1945. The paper models the vanished installations (now deep under the structures of the modern port) and
their environmental effects using data retrieved from fiscal, military, field survey, coastal survey, construction, and historical
depth sounding records, fitted into a 3D georegistered framework that seeks to include the past stream, marsh, and lagoon
hydrography of the hinterland and the likely discharge regimes under climatic conditions prevalent from c. 1450 to c. 1750.
