FROM DATA TO POLICY: HOW CAN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY CONTRIBUTE?
Author(s): Seetah, Krish (Stanford University)
Presentation Format: Oral
Deeply rooted connections exist between the period we consider as ‘historical archaeology’ and the present-day. This is perhaps
best exemplified by the activity that characterizes the recent past: massive landscape transformation, extensive demographic
flux, and escalated trade and exchange. Given these large-scale human-environmental changes, can the associated data – sequestered and effectively segregated from an archaeological agenda – be useful for speaking to policy makers?
