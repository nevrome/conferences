This presentation offers three case studies from Europe and Africa that utilize an archaeological approach, and archaeo-historic
datasets, with the express intent of contributing to policy. This support for policy development is based either on model building,
or direct integration of ‘heritage’ into new management strategies by local government in former colonial states. Overall, the
aim of the presentation is to demonstrate the increasingly important role archaeology can play within the context of supporting
resilience in the face of increasingly complex political, social and ecological contexts.
