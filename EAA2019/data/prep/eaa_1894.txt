Craft is guided by the body knowledge of the practitioner. Being a mostly non-verbalised part of the crafting process, this field of
knowledge is overshadowed by the dominance of our visual perception and therefore still mostly neglected in the archaeological
analysis of things.
While developing new process-based approaches (e.g. practitioner-researchers or researchers co-working with craftspeople)
we constantly have to reconsider the applicability of these theories to the analysis of the archaeological object. In addition,
the issue arises how we may deal with already traditionally classified findings? Another step to take is to make this knowledge
accessible to a greater group of researchers. Is it possible to create some kind of toolbox including the insights of the theories
around embodiment and implicit knowledge, so that it can be used in the daily archaeological routine?
This session will not only pay attention to the theoretical trends but also display diverse case studies through the ages including
copper smelting, seal production, the use of image-artefacts, pottery production, rock art, figurines and adornment.
Regarding these various materials and objects these case studies reveal learning networks, analyse sequences/backgrounds
of crafting gestures as well as the choice of raw materials by using fruitfully the cooperation with craftspeople. Furthermore
childhood studies will be presented as a promising source to examine the process of appropriation.
