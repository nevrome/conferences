THE HAPTIC DIMENSION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS: BETWEEN DOGMA AND PRAGMA
Author(s): von RÃ¼den, Constance (Ruhr-University Bochum)
Presentation Format: Oral
The almost exclusive focus on the visual perception of artefacts in archaeology and anthropology has been extensively criticized for the last 20 years at least. This discourse opened completely new theoretical perspectives on archaeological things by
integrating further sensual experiences as for instance olfaction, hearing or the tactility in our constructs of ideas (cf. Hamilakis
2014). However, despite its importance the discourse largely remained on a theoretical and thus often rather abstract, intellectual level. Especially its integration into the empirical data of archaeological field research is often still awkward or superficial.
