Touch, with its “boundary-blurring properties” (Howes – Classen 2014, 8) and its characteristic to evidently bridge the cartesian
idea of subject and object is of particular importance for the making of artefacts. To integrate the craftsperson’s bodily experience of the involved tools and raw materials as for instance clay, plaster or wood, is essential for our understanding of ancient
manufacturing processes. Thus, based on theoretical considerations drawing on phenomenology as well as practice theory, the
paper aims to explore not only the importance of such an approach in the study of the material remains of ancient craft, but
also possible methodological ways to tightly interweave the above mentioned theoretical and philosophical ideas into the daily
archaeological routine.
