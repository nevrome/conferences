Interdisciplinary research is promoted as a way forward in coping with the growing complexity of research environments. In the
context of archaeology, the knowhow of crafts persons has a great potential in aiding in the reconstruction of past events as
well as in the understanding of the many background factors that shaped those events. While crafts persons have traditionally
been occupied with their own craft rather than pursuing academic careers, the situation is now changing as education in the
arts and crafts have moved into the academic institutions. The growing number of crafts persons with an academic interest
and skills make these practitioners ample T-shaped collaborators especially in the field of archaeology and conservation. In this
presentation we will discuss three cases of collaborative practices between archaeologists/conservators and craftspeople and
point to the new breed of practitioner-researchers who incorporate both of these practices in their academic profiles. Drawing
on embodied cognition theory and auto-ethnographical reflections, we will dive deep into the crafts persons experiential and
embodied knowing and point to the importance of the sensory spectrum in this context. Also, aspects of empathy and affect
emerge in this process. Through this analysis we will present the possible benefits and challenges that interdisciplinary teams
can expect when inviting crafts people into their research teams.
