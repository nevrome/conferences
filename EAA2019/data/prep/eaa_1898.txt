TEXTURES, GESTURES, RECIPES: CRAFTING EMBODIED SKILL

Presentation Format: Oral
The discussion of ancient material culture has recently shifted from a narrow focus on the finished objects to broader considerations of materiality that emphasize affinities at the level of production. This shift has also called into question the conventional
dualism between creator/subject and material/object premised on the application of a mental design onto a passive material
substance. Instead, technical objects are seen to emerge out of the dialogue between materials and makers; materials provide
affordances for action, guiding the choices and decisions of the craftsperson, and therefore, play as much a role in the process
of creation, as the human hand that manipulates them. Building on these ideas, I discusss an aspect of the technical process
that has perhaps received less attention so far: in the cases where identical objects are created in different materials, how do we
understand technical becoming, and especially the synergy between concept and material? Is it useful to speak of prototypes
and imitations? Would that dissolve the entangled coming into being of technical objects? The role of imitation in this discussion
has been mainly to validate a sterile hierarchy of more and less ‘valuable’ raw materials. I suggest instead that we should examine
imitation as embodied skill and a key stage in the process of technical emergence. To do this we must focus on how technical objects participate in and reproduce shared value systems created by craft practice. I will illustrate my suggestions with examples
from the Bronze Age Aegean.
