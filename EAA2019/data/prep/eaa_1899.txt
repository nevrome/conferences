IMAGES THAT YOU FEEL - THE HAPTIC ASPECTS OF VISUAL CULTURE IN MESOPOTAMIA
Author(s): Wagner-Durand, Elisabeth (IANES / Tübingen)
Presentation Format: Oral
The primate of the visual has governed the analyses of images ever since. Whereas it is more than comprehensible that images
(pictures), are primarily approached, analyzed and interpreted via their visual dimension, they still represent artifacts / features
with certain material properties who address more than the sense of sight. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-sensory approach
to image-artifacts. The aim is to address issues of haptic properties either directly inherent in the objects’ materiality or simulated by the craftsperson’s treatment of the material. In this vein, issues of synesthesia as intended effects during the production
processes are addressed and analyzed too. To do so, focus will be set on both, the archaeological record, the artifacts themselves, as well as the written sources that give insight into the emic perception of sensory aspects of material life in Mesopotamia. The thesis is forwarded that image-artifact perception is a complex and often intentionally practiced interplay of different
sensory experiences and expectations that shape the way images are produced in Mesopotamia and beyond.
