finger imprints, these marks often inform us of the direction of the manufacturers’ gestures or of the amount of pressure applied
to the material. These observations – which can be made both visually and haptically – can be very helpful for archaeologically
understanding the technological implications of their manufacture process.
While such traces have often formed the topic of discussion in research on pottery, this is not so much the case for studies on
clay figurines. Figurine studies indeed lack a well thought-out analytical program where the sense of touch is concerned. In this
paper, I therefore present a methodology developed precisely for this end. Involving the redefinition and expansion of database
categories used for data gathering, and the establishment of an interdisciplinary and collaborative experimental program, the
methodology allows for the addressing of a range of new questions focused both on the process of figurine making as well as on
the use of the final product.
It is here argued that closer analyses of traces of touch, accompanied by tactile explorations of materials, allow for movement,
action and process to be more closely taken into account. It is indeed easy to bypass such considerations when studying artefacts with striking appearances. Movement, action and process, however, remain the foundation of these objects’ existence,
and often required very specific forms of knowledge and exchange between manufacturers to occur. Thus, the treasure trove of
information left by hands requires further examination with hands.
