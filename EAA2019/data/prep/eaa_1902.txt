TOOLS

Presentation Format: Oral
Through the Artisanal Perspective craft-knowledge becomes a resource for interpretations and deeper understanding of the
past through ancient technologies and crafting issues. During the last ten years a grid of theoretic and practical frameworks
has been developed. The author claims that ancient craft-knowledge can be read as a document by contemporary persons with
a contemporary craft-knowledge. This paper explores new archaeological insights generated by artisans’ understanding of how
their craft is performed. It offers a newly developed practical dimension to archaeology, based on skills and craft, revealing the
embodied knowledge of the past. The applicability is shown through different case studies. This communicative, interdisciplinary approach offers to take us back to the moment at which items came into being, allowing wooden artefacts to be scrutinised
once again by a master woodworker and returning sherds to their origin as malleable clay in the hands of a living potter. The Artisanal Perspective discusses levels of skill and offers new technological insights into materials and manufacturing choices that
can be detected through sensory assessments. It offers important complementary information to existing methods and theories used in archaeological analysis, and can be of great importance to both archaeologists and craft-persons in collaboration.
