BACK TO THE POTS – FROM THEORY TO METHOD USING THE CONCEPT OF EMBODIED KNOWLEDGE

Several recent studies have shown how co-working between archaeologists and craftspeople, and correspondingly the intense
engagement in the field of implicit knowledge, positively changed our approach on archaeological objects. In parallel and connected with this the Neurosciences provided an important insight for the understanding of the process of appropriation: Together with craftspeople they described not only the impact of the crafting process but also of the transfer of craft-bound values on
the neuronal system.
Subsequently distribution patterns are no longer a mere expression of the mobility of objects but also of the mobility of ideas.
These ideas are created, spread and maintained through networks of practice and networks of learning – using the individual
bodies of their members to store knowledge.
But confronted with objects during the daily archaeological routine, how exactly can we distinguish relevant features of an object? Which features are based on certain values bound to a learning network, which are based on an individual level of appropriation and which on the anatomy of the craftsperson? Together with members of the School for Pottery in Landshut these kinds of
thoughts were applied on Roman Common Ware from a pottery complex in the region around the Lake Zurich. Together we were
able to reconstruct crafting mechanisms and crafting networks behind diverse traces on certain vessels, which will be displayed.
