WHAT CAN BE PUT TOGETHER?

As skilled fieldworkers, surveyors, site managers and disseminators, archaeologists are practitioners of the craft of archaeology
as well as archaeology in a purely academical sense. In broad terms, archaeology as craft might be described as retro - engineering: An analytical praxis of dismantling material remains in order to understand the practical knowledge, technology and
intended purpose of an original complexity. In archaeological terms: excavation, embodied interpretation and reconstruction also
describes these operations.
In real life, archaeology as craft unfolds by side with other skilled practitioners, expertise, authorities and craft persons. In this
situation, the praxis of archaeology is always socially moderated by other praxis. In addition to any interdisciplinary exchange, a
direct outcome of this is a social positioning of practitioners in relation to the material world we study. From where we are reaching is therefor also an important matter in relation to a practical understanding of a material.
Archaeological retro-engineering may be able to analyse more than material components. It is a perspective always dealing with
an intentional/nonintentional human vs. non-human interplay. This can also make an embodied analysis intrinsic anthropocentric.
What, then, can archaeological retro-engineering successfully take apart, and what may we be able or unable to put together
again in a comprehensive way?
