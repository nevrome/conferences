Over the last decades, the interest in extractive copper metallurgy in archaeology has increased dramatically. This is not only due
to the application of new scientific methods, which have increased our understanding of the distribution of metals in prehistoric
Europe, but also due to intensive prospection and archaeological excavations - particularly in the Alpine region of Europe – which
have brought to light new and important empirical material. In this region there are a large number of Bronze Age and Early Iron
Age copper ore mines and smelting places, where remains of furnaces as well as other inorganic and organic remains connected
to smelting process have been discovered. This has given us an understanding of the smelting process and its technological
requirements. Combined with ethnographic descriptions of traditional copper ore mining and smelting in Nepal, this has given a
unique opportunity to actually perform experimental copper ore smelting based on both archaeological and ethnographic material. Therefore, over the last 10 years, we have tried to duplicate and reproduce the copper ore smelting process through experimental archaeology. Based on ethnographic accounts and descriptions the process and its requirements, this should be a more
or less straight forward line to success. However, as it turned out, it was not as easy to reproduce the smelting and to obtain
copper in a satisfying quality and quantity as we thought. This raised the question of why? We aim in this paper to approach this
problem both theoretically and practically, by looking into themes of implicit, explicit, and tacit knowledge, issues connected to
