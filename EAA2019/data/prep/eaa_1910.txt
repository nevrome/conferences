AND USE

Aegean sealstones have been studied extensively from stylistic, iconographic and administrative perspectives. By contrast,
their technology and practical use – both requiring a strong haptic relation to the objects – have attracted limited scholarly
attention. The project “3D-forensic analysis and contextualisation of Aegean seals and sealings”, currently underway at the Institute of Classical Archaeology, University of Heidelberg, combines traditional methods of study with 3D model analysis and
experimental archaeology in order to explore questions of craftsmanship and usage. In this paper, we will discuss two subjects:
a) The shift of seal-engraving technology from soft to hard stones around 1700 BC: it will be argued that the shift was the result
of developments in crafting techniques, which led from free-hand tools to a manually rotating one, and from there to complex devices for fast mechanical rotation. This innovation, which was based on the appropriation of pre-existing technical affordances,
changed drastically the bodily movements of craftsmen and, by consequence, their mental approach to the craft.
b) The actual practice of sealing: to complement and enrich the information derived from 3D analysis of seal impressions, we are
using practical experiments to explore how the seal user’s movements are fixed in the clay. Considerations include how differently shaped seals fit in the hand and guide their own usage, the relative values of intuition and experience, and the processes
by which the frequent use of seals leads towards embodied knowledge.
