A collaborative study of ancient artefacts by archaeologists and craftsmen can be highly productive. This is because they use
different but complementary approaches. Archaeologists examine artefacts as finished entities, and seek to understand their
artistic, social or technological contexts. Craftsmen, on the other hand, approach them as assemblages, or compositions, whose
various parts retain direct or indirect traces of their formation. By studying these traces, craftsmen can identify (or conjecture)
the morphology of the tool(s) used and the technical processes employed in their manufacture. This helps to refine the questions that can be addressed with archaeometric methods. Through this interaction, archaeologists and craftsmen build a solid
methodological background, which can eventually lead to reliable experimental reconstructions.
In this paper we will discuss such a collaborative project, which investigates Mycenaean goldsmithing. We will focus on tools and
techniques, and explain how we proceed from the identification of traces to the reconstruction of movements and practices.
We will demonstrate that the process of manufacture involved different stages of sensory interaction – haptic and other – with
materials (gold, other substances used in combination, glues etc.). We will also argue that craftsmen had often to create their
own specialized tools to perform advanced techniques. To be functional, such implements had to fit perfectly the craftsmen’s
hands and sense of touch; for that reason, tool-making was a crucial step in the technical process, and one that determined how
tools could become extensions of the craftsman’s body and mind.
