SEAC 27: ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL ASTRONOMY, BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN TRENCH AND
SKY
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes
Organisers: González-García, Antonio César (European Society for Astronomy in Culture - SEAC) - Criado Boado, Felipe (European Association of Archaeologists)
Format: Round table
All human societies live under a sky that may have been incorporated into their understanding of the world around them. In a
sense, if we define ‘astronomy’ as the impulse to look up into the sky for whatever purpose, then we can see that every society has had such impulse. Frequently these observations have been variously materialised in mobiliary and parietal art or in
monuments. These suggest a fruitful intersection between cultural astronomy and archaeology is possible. But a long series of
misunderstandings have kept archaeology and archaeoastronomy apart for a long time.
For mutual progress our two disciplines need to understand why and how this separation occurred and whether it is possible to
map out a route out of the impasse. In our view cultural astronomy has made a significant progress in recent decades and now
includes different methodological and theoretical trends. An example of this would be the recent proposal for a new ‘skyscape
archaeology’.
