the 25th annual meeting of the European Archaeologists Association (EAA) is a key moment for engaging in a fruitful dialogue
between the two disciplines to bridge the gap still existing. Some of the research questions that could be addressed are:
•
Is Cultural Astronomy giving answers for questions not (yet) posed by Archaeology?
•
Are we (cultural astronomers and archaeologists) asking the same questions?
•
Is arqueoastronomy an archaeometry or can it provide something else than data?
•
Should the sky be a relevant concept for archaeology?
Two members of each society will lead the debate trying to set the view of the other field from the back sight of their own, finally
opening the floor for comments and discussion from the general audience.
