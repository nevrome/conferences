Format: Regular session
Over the last 25 years, the archaeological study of historic and recent skeletal and other body tissues, the coffins, burial clothing and accessories and any accompanying items of material culture has become widespread in Europe. Whilst scientifically
important, the disturbance, recording and analysis of human remains and any closely associated material culture have ethical
dimensions which are unique when related to material from recent centuries. The remains are often in consecrated ground, and
the descendants of the deceased under study may be identifiable. Preservation may be exceptional, through mummification or
embalming, and the ethics of illustrating remains in publications or public displays require careful consideration. This session
brings together those experienced in dealing with these assemblages to outline and share not only practice and results but also
how the ethical dimension was dealt with in the planning and permission stage, and then in fieldwork, and finally during analysis
and dissemination.
The session organisers invite for paper submissions discussing the practice and ethics of not only study, identification and
display of human remains, but also the debatable issues concerning the associated textiles, coffins and other material remains.
