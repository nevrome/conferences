Presentation Format: Oral
Multidisciplinary research on partly mummified human remains still currently located under the church floors is relatively new in
Finland. Two ongoing projects studying Finnish under-church-floor burials have thus encountered various situations during the
research and dissemination of information that have required ethical reflections. Obtaining research permits has been dependent on the attitudes of individual congregations. Churches that are already out of active use are more easily persuaded to allow
the research and, for example, sampling of the remains and associated burial materials than those churches that still actively
serve as the primary sacred places of the congregations. Community archaeology done in collaboration with schools and museums has prompted discussions on how the results should be presented and what kind of visual material can be displayed and how
for different age groups. We have experienced the importance of explaining not only the traditions and stories related to death,
but also the characteristics of the earlier societies in which diseases and infant mortality played a major role.
