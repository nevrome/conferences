HUMAN REMAINS AND ASSOCIATED CULTURAL MATERIAL FROM ENGLISH CONSECRATED BURIAL
GROUNDS: UNPICKING ETHICS AND PRACTICE IN THE 2017 APABE GUIDANCE

Presentation Format: Oral
The Advisory Panel for the Archaeology of Burials in England (APABE) was established with a slightly different name in 2005, and
it is still an important collaborative advisory panel. It combines the views of Historic England as secular guardians of the heritage
and the Church of England as the body both legally and ethically responsible for many, though not all, of the historic consecrated
burial grounds, though none of the members of the committee or the consultative forum are clergy. This paper examines the
ethical framework proposed in the 2017 guidance, and it considers how this is now manifested in practice in small-scale and
large-scale disturbance of human remains. Whilst the guidance has been a collaborative process, there are still numerous and at
times competing interpretations and aspirations as to how the guidance may evolve. The culturally sensitive post-modern tradition of archaeology accepts diverse viewpoints (to which the religious communities would associate) regarding the meanings
and values of human remains. This contextual approach is often in conflict with the hard science attitude to human remains as a
resource to be exploited over the long term to better understand the past.
