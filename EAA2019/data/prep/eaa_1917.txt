Human remains excavated in the course of archaeological excavations change their status. The dead from the past become a
medium of information. When examining the problem of human corpses, a question arises as to the status of the dead body – is
a corpse solely dead matter with no dignity or should it be treated in a respectful and tactful manner?
In Polish legislation, human corpses and remains are considered as a good that is difficult to be determined in terms of content
and substance. Specific regulations regarding specific contents can be found in penal law, administrative law and international
law.
What constitutes the problem is the justification of excavating and scientifically examining human remains. The cause of conflicts lies in the difference between the expectations of the living and the rights of the dead. In the scientific discourse, human
remains constitute an evidence, a testimony to the past. However, treating human remains as objects of analysis leads to a
dehumanisation of the dead body.
Sadly, it should be stressed that some archaeologists adopt a somewhat arbitrary approach to the subject of ethical treatment
of human remains uncovered during excavations. This is evidenced by the fact that in Poland, only one code of ethics addresses
the matter of a dignified treatment of human remains.
The presented paper, apart from discussing the legal and ethical aspects of human remains in Polish archaeology, also presents
specific examples of problems tackled by archaeologists examining burial sites – from prehistoric cemeteries and early medieval
barrows to modern exhumations of the Cursed Soldiers.
