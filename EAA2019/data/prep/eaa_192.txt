Presentation Format: Oral
A common thread through historical accounts cross-culturally, spatially and temporally is that pregnancy was often a happy
event that gave hope for the future but was also a time of fear and concern for the safety of the mother and child, both of whom
were considered at risk of death. The juxtaposition of bringing forth new life and potential loss of life elicited a complex range
of emotions and theological considerations. Early Christian doctrine spearheaded by St Augustine of Hippo (AD 354-430) held
the view that unbaptised souls could not enter heaven so how did this impact upon pregnant women and their unborn babies –
entwined souls of the baptised and unbaptised? The paper will review evidence from sites spanning the Early Medieval to Post
Medieval periods in Ireland to see what the archaeological evidence reveals. The data set includes the burials of women and their
unborn babies from both consecrated burial grounds and the later unconsecrated cillíní to see if differences in the frequencies
of such pairings are evident across these sites. The nature of the funerary rituals afforded to the mothers and babies will also be
investigated to gain insights in relation to contemporary attitudes to maternal-infant deaths.
