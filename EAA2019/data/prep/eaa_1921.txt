There are a lot of fruitful conversation concerning about ethical questions related to the archaeological research on burials. But
what forms a burial? This paper converses on early modern church graves at the coastal area of Finland. A burial usually includes
a body, fabrics, objects, ornaments, and plants buried with the deceased. Among other things, these under-floor burials were
provided for several reasons with different plants, etc. spruce sprig, sawdust, birch bark or hay. However, after the ceremony
the coffins have filled with other remains, which were not a part of the original burial. How about the post-burial remains such as
insects and rodent traces? How to deal with them? Sometimes burials have been disturbed by several different parties causing
changes. Whether handling the remains is allowed seems to be case related. Who can determine what belongs to a burial? This
paper discusses how these post-burial remains have been handled.
