Over the last decades, forensic experts have participated in investigations of individual burial places and mass graves from
recent armed conflicts around the world. These investigations have given rise to ethical principles and recommendations, which
have been published e.g. as the Resolution of United Nations Human Rights Council on Human rights and forensic science (E/
CN.4/RES/2005/26), as the resolution on Forensic genetics and human rights (A/HRC/RES/15/5), and UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (also known as Minnesota protocol). These
resolutions and recommendations address the dignified handling and management of human remains and restoring the identity
of victims, among other things. In this paper, forensic investigations of mass graves and alleged human rights violations in former Yugoslavia are presented as an example to present the differences in the ethical principles applied in forensic science and
archaeology. We also consider whether archaeology teams can learn from the ethical issues and recommendations of forensic
science, and ask could these recommendations be incorporated in archaeological excavations and studies of sites with particularly sensitive aspects and issues, such as grave sites of the victims of recent civil wars and world wars?
