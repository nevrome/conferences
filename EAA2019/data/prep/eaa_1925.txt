While discussions of wealth and status often present such privilege as a case of “haves” and “have nots”, in reality these concepts are less clear-cut, as individuals who enjoy privilege in one area may not be privileged in others.
As such, it is important to recognize the ways privilege is created and enforced on two levels: (1) how individuals were treated
and interred in the past, and (2) the ways in which their remains are archaeologically interpreted and presented today. This paper
considers these levels in the context of a series of children’s burials from pre-modern northern Finland which occupies a unique
niche, representing economically privileged children buried in often prestigious locations, who receive unique treatment in contrast with their elders. In the present, this requires a critical consideration of how current conceptions and prejudices around the
death of a child presented to the public at large, as these beliefs can under-privilege conversations around children and childhood
in the past.
This paper addresses the following questions: How is privilege seen as a complex concept in archaeological burials? How do
changes in modern perceptions of privilege shift presentations of the past? Do other factors (such as preservation bias) impact
archaeological presentations of these identities? What impacts does developing perceptions of privilege have on ethical obligations?
Archaeology has a great deal of potential to present a more holistic picture, but must do so in an intentional, critical, ethical and
informed manner to avoid perpetuating current biases.
