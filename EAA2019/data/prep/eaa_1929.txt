Public interpretation of cultural and natural heritage has a deep legacy, extending back millennia as attested to by the archaeological record itself. Yet the formal professionalisation of interpretative practice has progressed most rapidly over the past century, especially in recent decades with the birth of myriad local, national and international expert guidelines, certifying bodies,
and other representative organisations. Virtually all such formal structures of professional heritage interpretation recognise
the centrality of emotion to its effectiveness: interpretation must inspire, resonate, provoke, move - it must have an *affective*
impact - to truly influence people’s understandings of, care for, and future actions around heritage. However, the universalising
language and assumptions that underlie this professional rhetoric about emotion take little to no account of cultural difference.
Even prominent anthropological and cultural theorists regularly draw on flawed models of affect that mask nuanced patterns of
behaviour, privilege Anglo-American epistemologies, or reduce behaviours to innate psychobiological responses.
Guided by Margaret Wetherell’s affective practices model, we present here our experiences in developing and evaluating emotionally-resonant heritage interpretation in the context of the EU-funded EMOTIVE Project (www.emotiveproject.eu). We reflect
on intercultural engagements with on-site and off-site (digital) interpretative resources created for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey. Our preliminary findings hint at cultural (and other) differences in audience response to these
resources, and therefore at the need to attune development from the outset to cultural circumstances. We conclude, then,
with consideration of existing frameworks for public interpretative practice, questioning whether their universalising tendencies
eclipse the local, personal, affective outcomes that are key to care for heritage.
