locally specific heritage, archaeology and art. All artists and archaeologists in this project have a connection with and knowledge
relating to the areas in County Clare, western Ireland and on the island of Öland, southeastern Sweden. The work includes heritage interpretation, community engagement and not least interaction and co-creation.
Going beyond institutional norms and practices, we let the combined arts and archaeology practice for enhanced heritage relevance emerge from within and through landscapes. We thereby avoid the skepticism in today’s rural areas towards central
institutions, that are often seen as solely representing and primarily embracing authorized and/or urban culture. We develop a
translocal practice that can be applied in an international context but that has no strivings to be the singular dominant paradigm.
The international perspective is crucial, but instead of aiming towards dominance, we focus more on sharing practices. Local
artists, authors, archaeologists, heritage and culture workers are engaged in the processes of unfolding both the hidden and the
more obvious dimensions of local heritage.
