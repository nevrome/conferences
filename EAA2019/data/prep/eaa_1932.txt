In a suburban area in the northeast parts of Gothenburg in Sweden, you can find the remains of a cist grave situated among many
high-rise houses. Who cares about these remains today and who knows anything about them? Questions raised in the NEARCH
project “Here I live” was how we could make a different kind of archaeological interpretation that could be of some relevance to
inhabitants living in the area today. It is a multicultural region with people from about 50 different countries around the world:
everybody with their own story. Could there be a theme and a story involving both present and past using archaeology and heritage? People have been living here for 4000 years and this became the theme of the project. Who were those people and what
stories can they tell and how do we include the present?
A new kind of signage in cooperation with a landscape architect was designed with the purpose of being a gathering place for storytelling. The installation, which opened September 2018, offers opportunities of sitting down and moving around at different
levels. There are panels with many stories and boxes with archaeological material. It is enlightened to be used also during evenings. At the panels, the children’s voices from different times are in focus since the site today mostly function as a playground
for the children in the area. There is pedagogical material published online and the schools can make use of the site as an outdoor
classroom. Different projects connected to the interpretation is ongoing with local associations and the housing company in
the area. This project is an example of how a different kind of interpretation might contribute challenging how to think about
archaeology and heritage.
