EMBRACING THE POLYSEMANTIC: PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION
Author(s): Jones, Emily Lena (University of New Mexico)
Presentation Format: Oral
Public archaeology” is a term with multiple meanings. In the USA, this term may signify any combination of the following: cultural
resource management; heritage formation, administration, and/or interpretation; formal or informal collaboration with indigenous or other local communities; elementary or secondary archaeological education; and general public outreach, among other
definitions. More, the “public” in any of these definitions may vary; it may be international, national, regional, and/or local. Despite
this nebulous situation, however, professional education in public archaeology is in great demand, by prospective students and
by the archaeological community alike. This poses a challenge: how do we educate public archaeology professionals in this context? This presentation surveys the ways in which the term public archaeology is used within educational programs in the USA,
and then uses the University of New Mexico’s graduate program in Public Archaeology as an example of engaging with multiple
definitions as a component of professional education.
