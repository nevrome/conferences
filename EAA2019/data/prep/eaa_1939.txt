of intensive construction of a state energy program, and central focus on a planned economy. The main precepts were established, a need for compulsory excavation of sites destroyed during construction was established, and a procedure laid down for
financing surveys. The authorities urged that ‘conscious citizens’ with an interest in history, as well as specialists, should enrol
in identifying archaeological sites. Dozens of expeditions were conducted. They included Academy of Sciences, museums, universities. The Soviet state took complete responsibility for archaeological heritage – financing identification, creating registers,
and protecting the archaeological legacy.
The system of conservation in the post-WW2 USSR worked at varying levels of efficiency. A database of sites was established
for hitherto unsurveyed regions.
The first post-soviet decades, and the chaotic 1990s shift to democracy saw a meltdown in protection for Russian archaeological heritage. Economic and political crisis became the backdrop for decline in research levels. Transfer of land to private hands
prompted difficulties in protecting and preserving archaeological sites.
In the recent decades which followed ratification of the La Valletta Convention in Russia, new legislation has appeared governing
archaeological heritage, enabling its protection within Russia.
