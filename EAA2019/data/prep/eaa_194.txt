This paper leads a reflection about how far we can go in comparing results from excavation and field data on the one hand and
from biological study of human remains on the other. First of all, one must establish how precise data must be on each hand. Considering that results must be as reliable as possible, data must be as precise as possible, but very different factors can threaten
this precision: taphonomy, available time, field and lab methods, sample size, sample representation etc. In which conditions are
we able to characterize a population through an excavated buried sample of individuals, what further information can we reach in
crossing data? What tools can we expect to obtain gathering data from both field and lab and what is their reliability?
We shall first consider the problematics in their theoretical context, then present a systemic approach organised by levels.
The second part is an application through an archaeological case, with the study of stillborn, foetuses and babies from Saint
Ayoul parish cemetery, near Paris. We cross practises during life (babies wrapped up) and after death (specialized cemetery area,
coffins, shroud, …), biological data (age at death, pathologies, anatomical variability) and written sources (iconography, parish
registers, …) to characterise particular behaviours in live and death of the little ones.
