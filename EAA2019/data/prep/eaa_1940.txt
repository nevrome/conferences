During Soviet occupation Latvian archaeology, as well as other sciences and entire aspects of life where reorganised after the
official ideology of the Soviet Union (USSR): Marxism–Leninism. The goal was to build the communism, but prior to that all preceding views about the past had to be revised and adjusted in order to fit the theory of evolution towards the ‘‘World communism’’.
Although it is widely agreed that history and prehistory were those spheres where ideology was just a formality, there is no doubt
that archaeologists also had to contribute to the regime. Today it needs to be asked, whether we realise how much Marxism has
affected and even distorted the science? Marxism still is seen as a legitimate scientific theory to be applied in research, but
there are few discussions about the anachronistic and selective character of this approach towards the past realities.
By giving overview of the Latvian archaeological thought under the Soviet rule, in this paper I suggest that it is extremely important to understand and acknowledge the ideologies underlying our work, how much they can help explain our research material or
lead us to erroneous assumptions and vague scientific compromises.
