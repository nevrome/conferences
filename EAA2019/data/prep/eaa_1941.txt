PALAST DER REPUBLIK: AN URBAN LANDMARK AS CONTESTED CULTURAL HERITAGE

Presentation Format: Oral
The Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic, 1973-1979), a fiercely rectilinear, bronze-clad edifice in the heart of East Berlin,
was standing in defiance to the 19th century urban etiquette until its demolition in 2008. The building, typical of its time, modern and socialist, was considered variously as an urban aberration, or else as a testimony to a post World War Two ‘Brave New
[socialist] World’.
Intense debate was caused among the local population and the political world upon the state’s decision for the Palast der Republik’s demolition and its replacement, starting in 2013, with the Humboldt Forum museum, a building with three of its sides being
exact replicas of the original mid 16th century Berlin Palace/ Stadtschloss that once stood in the same location.
The Palast der Republik represents the old division of the city and created a new division within the city, posing the question of
the type of political identity we are seeking for our cities and the way in which it is informed by the urban heritage and specific
monuments of the city.
The research wishes to offer a discussion on the monument’s identity and its role as a landmark in the redefinition of public space
in the center of unified Berlin, as filtered in the construction of the new monument-to-be of the Humboldt Forum museum; the
importance of the particular site within the institutional order of the city – both the divided and the reunited one; the tension
between the historical legacy and ideological imaginary attached to the original Berlin Palace and the Palast der Republik as a
place for the people and as a place of power.
