Dictatorial regimes often appropriate cultural heritage for propaganda purposes. This is a simple truth, which makes us forget,
that their interpretations of cultural heritage evolved through the duration of the regime. This is the fact with the ritualization of
historical sites and with the integration of historical symbolism into their iconographic language. Material culture is an incarnation of societies. As such the imitation of older civilizations, most notably the Romans, by the Italian fascists, represents a vision
of themselves in their ideal future.
