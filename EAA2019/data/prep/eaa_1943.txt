This self-aggrandizement is the driving force behind the interest fascism displays in archaeology. It drives the fascists to integrate the “glorious” past into their world. This was done in many ways. The most direct was the integration of archaeological sites
into propaganda; another was the imitation of the past, which can be seen in fascist urbanism and colonialism. We propose to
analyse the fascist urban heritage as an imitation and appropriation of the past, where urbanism and its’ aesthetics represent
an archaeological monument.
A suitable example is the mining colony of Raša in Istria, a part of a much bigger project of regional bonification, civilizing the fringes of the Italian state similar to the way the regime saw the Romans as the bringers of civilization. We intend to analyse how the
appropriation of the past informed the construction of this colony, how it was integrated into the fascist imaginary system and
how it was intended to reinforce the ideals of the regime in the material world, how it became an archetype of fascist colonialism.
We intend to analyse how Raša lived and lives on, through the socialist Yugoslavia and today in Croatia, how it was re-imagined to
the new historical environment and what its’ perspectives as an example of a historical urban environment are.
