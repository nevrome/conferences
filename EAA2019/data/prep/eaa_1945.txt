ANTIQUITY

The relationship between the Italian fascist regime and Roman archeology is based on an extreme simplification of antiquity,
reduced to a mere set of aesthetic motifs used in virtue of their symbolic power. On the images of ancient Rome, the regime
established a cult of Romanity that was one of the fundamental elements of its propaganda.
The use of Romanity as a propaganda tool was not, however, an invention of fascism, this cultural process had been started in
the decades immediately following the completion of the unification of Italy by the official organs of the former Savoyard state.
In fact, once the Italian state had been built, the problem was to give the nation a cultural form and a unitary heritage.
The young state needed an imaginary model of reference for its community; a common historical denominator was needed to
justify the existence of a nation which until then had been perceived as extremely varied. In the wake of the Risorgimento movements that were pursuing a patriotic awakening even through a rediscovery of antiquity, the official culture of post-unification
Italy showed a renewed interest in Romanity.
Roman archeology and its images were one of the most effective tools used by official culture to provide the new nation with a
common past, forging it from an imagined community. In the degeneration of this nationalistic cultural movement we can recognize the themes underlying the fetishization and the distortion of the Romanity occurred in Mussolini’s Italy, perceptible very
clearly in the aesthetics and in the whole communication system of the fascist state.
