the Spanish and the U.S. colonial regimes. This precolonial New Society knowledge relied on archaeological excavations, anthropological research, and institutional support that the star students of both Philippine and U.S. heritage who had graduated from
the University of Chicago provided Ferdinand Marcos with. The Chicago graduates occupied key positions within the academy
and in the National Museum of Anthropology of the Philippines. In this paper, I will thus ponder the following questions: In what
way did these archaeologists and anthropologists biographically, institutionally and scientifically become entangled with the
U.S.-backed Marcos regime? How were they complicit? This paper – although focusing on an Asian dictator not an American or
European one – will locate itself within this session by showing how archaeology and anthropology became the central spaces
that were shaped against a Cold War/Postcolonial backdrop. I will argue that Cold War money, U.S. anxieties about communism in
Asia, and neocolonial continuities created an archaeology that catered to the needs of a dictator.
