Stone artefact typologies remain a key component of lithic studies, typically combined with studies of the chaine operatoire
or organisation of technology in modern analytical approaches. The use of these latter approaches can offer a more detail on
stone reduction practices from the past than typological approaches alone, as well as avoiding implicit functional assumptions
of some stone tool types or the impact of reduction intensity on the form of discarded stone tools. However, their application
is time consuming and a range of practical issues from accessing collections and curation practices up to priorities of funding
bodies can limit their use on historic lithic assemblages. In contrast, typologies have been widely employed throughout the history of Palaeolithic research, but offer more limited detail on past behaviour. While synthesising typological terminologies used
by different analysts presents problems, devising methods for integrating historic and modern typological datasets offers the
means to explore lower resolution patterns of behavioural change at larger geographic and temporal scales. Here, I hope to set
out the methods Iâ€™ve employed in synthesising Palaeolithic datasets in South-West Asia and East Africa to open them up to
quantitative analysis, and the extent to which they can inform (and be informed by) more detailed, site focused attribute analyses from both regions.
