SO IT SEEMS WE’RE ALL AGITATED! WHY “WE TRIED IT AND IT DOESN’T WORK” DOESN’T WORK

While different materials from prehistory are getting increasing attention, large amounts of Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic
artefacts are still comprised of lithic artefacts. Since this is largely due to reasons of preservation, many sites are only known
from surface finds and especially those with extensive artefact spectra are recorded in heritage databases. However, such sites
often comprise multi-phased campsites or palimpsests, alas they are often heavily deteriorated due to e.g. ploughing which
surfaced the artefacts. Even though their scientific and interpretational value is generally of minor importance, if settlement
structures are in focus, they are still providing relevant information on the distribution of camps and can inform about the use
and change of landscapes.
However, studies that want to analyse overarching patterns ironically often only work in restricted areas which is commonly due
to different artefact taxonomies or typologies. While it is of course possible to translate between typologies if, for instance,
the finds are displayed or formally described, quantitative and explorative analyses are often subject to an initial data homogenization. In this contribution I want to address some short-comings of current archaeological research from a typological and
practical perspective. I will argue that even though a lot of time (and hence money) was spent to acquire data that is of hardly
any use in its current form. This contribution will argue that homogenization is utterly necessary and, if tried always subject to
compromises and the respect research question.
