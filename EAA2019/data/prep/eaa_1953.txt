KNOTTING, TWISTING AND PLAITING: LOOKING FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCES
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes

Format: Regular session
Gestures such as knotting, twisting and plaiting were involved in the oldest processes of crafting plants; and were also crucial for turning plant (and animal) fibres into ropes, nets, mats and baskets among others. As other plant-based crafts this kind
of objects have been usually perished and their evidences rarely survived in archaeological contexts, despite they developed
essential roles in the day-to-day activities such as storing, carrying and fastening, in domestic activities or even in activities
such as firewood procurement, gathering, hunting or fishing. Their poorly preservation in the archaeological record stresses the
urgency of discussing about this kind of crafts. This session welcomes contributions dealing with direct and indirect archaeological evidence of knotting, twisting and plaiting, the technological know-how associated to fibre-crafting, the social and gender
dimension of crafting plants, and especially those presenting combined evidences, multidisciplinary or ethnoarchaeological approaches. This session is organised in conjunction with the PlantWild Community of EAA.
