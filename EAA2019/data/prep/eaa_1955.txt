until the 20th century. The archaeological record shows general uniformity throughout the sequence. A subsample of 84 macro-remains -inflorescences, fruits, seeds, leaves, woods- of the late period of occupation (1500 years BP to the 20th century)
was studied in a previous project. Among the identified taxa are: Larrea sp., Schinus sp., Adesmia sp., Ephedra sp., Colliguaja integerrima and aff. Chuquiraga erinaceae. In this presentation, histological sections of cordage were observed with stereoscopic
and optical microscope and compared with herbarium material from the Monte and the Patagonian steppe. Some taxa, such as
Juncus sp., were employed for manufacturing cordage. Attributes and features of this technology are described. These results
were compared with basketry from Epull√°n Grande cave, distant 100 m from ECh. Based in these results, the harvesting and
postharvest practices concerning plants and manufacture techniques are discussed.
