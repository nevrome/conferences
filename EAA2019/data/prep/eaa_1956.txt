Imprints of cords and knots are prominent in the decoration of particular ceramic wares, including pottery made by hunters and
fishers in the early prehistory of Northern Europe. In this context there is an obvious but hitherto little-explored link to the fibre
technologies employed in making equipment for catching and gathering food from the wild. This paper looks at the imprints made
in pottery using a tool wound with cord, known as “cord stamp” or “wound cord” – an impressed decoration technique commonly
represented in the early pottery of the East Baltic region and other areas. The main focus is on this mode of ornamentation as
used on pottery from the Riņņukalns shell midden of the 4th millennium BC in northern Latvia, which is examined from a technological perspective and discussed in relation to the remains of cordage from the same period in the East Baltic. The study
employs microscopy and image processing to reveal technologically diagnostic features of the decoration.
