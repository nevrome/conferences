Basketry has solved several needs in preindustrial societies. This craft, widely spread in all the world, has been used to produce
containers for a great diversity of purposes: storing, cooking or serving food, as well as other finalities like sieving for example.
Despite the importance of basketry in modern societies, their preservation in European prehistoric sites is limited, and, as a consequence, the knowledge about the origins of the techniques used, raw materials, and morphologies as well as its geographical
and chronological distribution is scarce.
Waterlogged sites are one of the main contexts where baskets are preserved, providing an incomparable frame to study of this
craft and its social and economic implications. This paper presents the basket remains recovered at the early Neolithic site of La
Draga (7300-7000 cal BC). The site has provided a singular sample of basketry corresponding to the first farming communities
settled in the Northeast of Iberian Peninsula. The interrelation between materials, techniques of manufacture and the potential
function are evaluated.
