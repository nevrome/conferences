Evidences related to basketry technology are rather frequent at Iron Age contexts of Northwest Iberia and was probably crucial
in the day-to-day life of these communities. Basketry technology was used for making wattle-hurdles, mats for floor and bedding
and different kind of containers. Direct evidences of hurdles and baskets such as charred wood remains -including twigs and
wood strips- have been recovered from contexts related to fire events (e.g. Castrovite, Monte do Castro, Nab√°s, etc.). Corylus,
Alnus and Salix/Populus amongst other taxa have been identified in relation to this kind of objects and structures providing
information about how this communities managed the wild through silvicultural practices. Whilst their main indirect evidences include impressions in clay of wattle hurdles and baskets and the representation of mats or other objects that have been
carved in stone sculptures. There have been also summarised the toolmarks and tools related to basket-making that have been
identified in Iron Age contexts. Current ethnobotanical data and experiences accumulated by crafters of this geographical area
provide also information about the seasonality of tasks performed by basket-makers or even about the existence of gender bias
in basket-making.
