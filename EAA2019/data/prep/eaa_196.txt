One of the most intriguing funeral practices which had earlier been described only at three Neolithic sites in Sudan are burials in
ceramic vessels. The tradition had been rather widely common in prehistoric times, and the oldest examples probably originate
from the North Levant (end of the 7th millennium BC). Neolithization came to Sudan from the north, probably as an entire packet
of changes, not only economic. These were clearly reflected in funeral practices as well, which had undergone a radical metamorphosis, while substantial changes in the rituals are a clear sign of a change in beliefs and social organization. What is interesting,
in Sudan pot burials have a slightly older chronology than in Egypt. Yet another matter is the role of the vessels themselves as funerary containers. Some researchers believe that they had been deliberately selected and reused, which was dictated by a variety of reasons - pragmatic, as well as symbolic (e.g. relation between vessels and wombs and eggs, the Egyptian symbols of life).
Four graves had been investigated in Khor Shambat. Found in a trench with an area of 4 m2, were Early Neolithic foetuses and
infant pot burials with relatively abundant burial goods. The vessel type ceramics, as well as the radiocarbon date, suggest a
chronology of around 4300-4100 cal BC.
