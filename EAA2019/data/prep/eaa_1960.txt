political and social changes that occurred in the territory of al-Andalus during the Emiral period. The documented urbanism presents distinct zones with a complex distribution. The sudden abandonment of the site was due to a generalized fire level identified, and no other settlements were founded after this episode.
This settlement has undergone an exhaustive process of recovery and analysis of archaeobotanical remains for almost ten
years. The well-preserved refilled layers in the silos, consumption inside de houses and the wooden roofings led the research
team the determination of a vast range of wild and domesticated plants like cereals, pulses, fruits, oilseeds, firewood and beams.
Charcoal and carpological analyses have documented more than 29 taxa, but this study focuses on Stipa tenacissima taxon.
These remains use to be poorly preserved but the fire action and decomposed masonry covered charred objects of esparto
grass. In order to recover these objects, it was necessary to carry out in-situ conservation with a micro-excavation, parallel to
the pre-treatment, subsequent extraction and transfer to the laboratory for ultimate consolidation. In almost all the floated sediment samples, esparto grass was recovered, meaning the economic importance and versatile objects production. The results
have been remarkable for the knowledge of twisting and plaiting processes for mat and basket production, where ethnology and
gender perspective are taken into account.
The City of Alhama de Murcia is the promoter of historical research and archaeological work in Las Paleras, through Los Ba√±os
Archaeological Museum. The archaeobotanical research counts on the University of Murcia (Spain) and University of Hohenheim
(Germany) essential contribution.
