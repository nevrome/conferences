While direct evidence of objects made of plants is rare in archaeology outside particular conservation contexts, it is possible to
approach them indirectly when they leave their mark on a support that has preserved, such as pottery.
In sub-Saharan West Africa, various types of basketry and nets have been used to shape pottery, and have left their imprint. In
addition, many different vegetable roulettes, based on twisted, braided or knotted cords, and folded or braided strips, have been
manufactured for several millennia to decorate the body surfaces of ceramics.
Some of these tools are still present today. An ethno-archaeological study conducted in several ethnic groups in Mali revealed
their technical and socio-cultural significance.
Important work has also been done on issues of identification and terminological homogenization. The publication of a bilingual
textbook is now bearing fruit by making it easier to compare ceramic assemblages of archaeological sites from different regions
and periods, studied by archaeologists from different research traditions.
Despite their minor part in the material culture made up of plant elements, these potters’ tools show the great diversity of techniques known and implemented, and their importance in the definition of identity for numerous cultural groups. This makes it
possible to imagine what it could have been like with all the missing perishable objects.
