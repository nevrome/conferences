Clay, metal, bone and stone items represent the most evident traces of the human activity in the Iron Age and Middle Ages in
Western Siberia. Referring to some tools, we can assume that they were used for processing of organic materials such as leather,
plant fibers and wool which unfortunately have not been preserved.
However, there is an evidence which proves the existence of developed thread braiding, wool spinning and weaving skills. Occasionally it is possible to encounter imprints of fabrics or woven floor mats made of plant fibers on the ceramic vessels of different
historical periods. Preserved due to a proximal location to metal items, fragments of textile can sometimes be found in graves.
Ornaments on the pottery of the Kashino culture (Western Siberia, the Tobol river valley, the early Iron Age) were made by cord
impressions. Usually the upper part of a ceramic vessel was decorated with a cord impression. The border ornament was a characteristic feature. It was composed of 2-4 horizontal line impressions, and zigzag signs, round brackets, crosses, and columnar
shapes were placed in-between. The irregularity of the cord is clearly visible in its impressions. The cord or the wisp consisted
of 5-7 threads or fibers. Threads were made of coarse wool or plant fibers (nettle or cannabis). The cords differed in thickness,
density and twisting method (S or Z). The plant fiber cord impressions were usually deeper and had sharp margins.
Furthermore, the tradition of the cord-impressed decoration of ceramic vessels had also been preserved in the materials of the
Yudino culture which was localized in this territory during the Middle Ages.
