THE SOUTHERN LEVANT

It is generally accepted that the choice of foods that we eat, how we prepare them and how we eat them, are a reflection of our
ethnic identity. An even more compelling ethnic signature are the foods that are excluded and are taboo to communities worldwide. The taboo that has probably received the most academic attention is the prohibition on the consumption of pork for Jews
and Muslims, a practice that is based on religious codes, and is a feature which sets these communities apart from others.
The reasons for this taboo are still debated and although relevant, will not be explored in this paper which will focus on whether
we can determine when such a distinction first became apparent in the archaeological record of the southern Levant (the region
spanning southern Syria, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan). It then tracks how pork consumption manifested itself
during the Persian, Roman and Byzantine periods with the rise of pagan and Christian communities in the region, and finally, what
happened with the arrival of early Islam ca. 638 AD. This overview will be based on numerous published archaeozoological assemblages from sites in the southern Levant. The discussion of this data set is inexorably entwined with the question - of whether
archaeozoological data by itself can serve as a reliable tool for assessing ethnic identity in past communities.
