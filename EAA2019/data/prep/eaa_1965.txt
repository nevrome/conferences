The relationship between Jews and Christians in the late- and post-medieval Central Europe has always been a complex one.
Historical texts provide much of the known information about the coexistence of the two communities; however, they often lack
geographical resolution and leave regional blank spots. This paper tackles this issue from a zooarchaeological perspective, by
investigating the foodways and meat trade between Jews and Christians.
The paper presents a few case-studies of zooarchaeological analysis of data from Jewish archaeological sites from Polish, Silesian, and Bohemian cities and towns. The sites represent rural producer and urban consumer sites, allowing for an investigation
of the relationships between those two types of sites, patterns of husbandry and animal products available to urban consumers. The analysis of species and body parts has provided information about food preferences and wealth of the communities.
Comparisons between Jewish and Christian sites revealed how the trade of non-kosher meat was shaped by the relationships
between the Jews and their Christian neighbours. Finally, the biometrical data have demonstrated the difference of the quality
of animals that were used to supply the two communities.
