The family of Abraham and Fanny Block represent the earliest documented Jewish immigrants to Arkansas in the United States,
arriving from Bohemia by way of Virginia in 1827. Isolation from the Jewish religious infrastructure they were accustomed to
in Europe meant the Blocks had to make concessions regarding their religious practices. Archaeological investigation at their
family home in Washington, Arkansas since the 1980s has produced no overt evidence of a Jewish religious practices in the
household. However, while the family’s Jewish identity was pushed to the margins they may have taken subtle means of adapting
their faith to life on the American frontier. Faunal remains recovered from the in the form of an articulated chicken burial and two
kitchen and food waste middens support the idea that Ashkenazic folk religious practices were being undertaken in the household in a way that avoided religious persecution and social ostracization from their non-Jewish neighbors. This zooarchaeological
evidence provides the framework for understanding folk traditions such as the koshering of kitchen vessels and the atonement
ritual of Kapparot as a means of remaining connected to the broader Jewish Diaspora while living outside of Jewish community
in Europe.
