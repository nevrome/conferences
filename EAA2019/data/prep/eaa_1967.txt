Presentation Format: Oral
The Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was a far-reaching process that implied the transformation of the previous sociocultural, economic and political structures. From the 711 AD, the former Hispania, known from that point on as al-Andalus,
became part of a wider Islamic cultural and religious koin√© that encompassed North Africa, the Levant and far beyond. By being
incorporated into the Islamic world, Iberia became exposed to new culinary influences and it seems possible that their uptake
was accompanied by different techniques of food preparation and cooking.
The aim of this paper is to offer insights into the historical dynamic of the emerging period of al-Andalus through the assessment
of the patterns of animal-based food consumption observed in a set of zooarchaeological assemblages dated between the 8th
and the 10th centuries AD. The approach adopted emphasises the social and cultural significance of foodways, highlighting the
relevance of the patterns observed for addressing the analysis of the process of Islamisation, conceived as the most powerful
engine of social transformation in Iberia during the early medieval period.
