MEDIEVAL CHANGING TOWN

Presentation Format: Oral
Between the 10th and 15th centuries, the present-day port city of Palma (Mallorca, Balearic Islands) played a key role in the
process of formation of different social, political and cultural communities who lived in the island. Within its walls, groups of
different religious identity (i.e., Muslims, Jews and Christians) and socio-economic status (from slaves to social elites) shared
an urban space that required the constant supply of food. It is expected that this food procurement was in accordance with the
cuisine and foodway demands of the dominant social group for each period: the Muslims in the Islamic period (10th-13th) and
the Christians in the Feudal period (13th-15th). Thus, these modes of acquisition and consumption should be recognizable in the
archaeological record despite constrains imposed by other factors such as the mode of production and the insular environment
from where those resources were extracted. This communication synthesises faunal data from medieval archaeological sites
in Palma. The aim is to identify zooarchaeological evidence that can improve our understanding of socio-economic status and
cultural identities of the dwellers that inhabited the town throughout its historical development. The main zooarchaeological
indicators for social differentiation are explored: sex, age, size and meat cuts (taking into account different types of sites – high
status residence versus industrial area), and different socio-political systems (Islamic and Christian periods), from a diachronic
perspective.
