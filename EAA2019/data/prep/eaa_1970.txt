formed, the structure of the plots changed, and the previous structures destroyed. In this context of transformations, c. 1516
AD a former water well was sealed and reused as a rubbish dump, throwing into it materials of construction, pottery fragments
and faunal remains.
The aim of the paper is to present the results of the zooarchaeological analysis of this archaeofaunal assemblage, offering a
glimpse into the production and distribution system of animal products during the early Modern Age in the core of the late Nasrid
Kingdom of Granada. Furthermore, the patterns of meat consumption observed allows to suggest the maintenance of Islamic
foodways –mainly characterised by the absence of Sus (pig/wild boar) remains– even when other aspects of the food system
changed as the consequence of the Christian conquest. The case of study highlights the inextricable connection between sociocultural identity and foodways during a period defined by profound transformations.
