In the 9th century AD, Sicily became a frontier of the Muslim world. The Arabs introduced several socio-cultural and economic
changes, which also impacted on the dietary habits of the local Christian population. Food is often used as a means of ethnic
differentiation between different religious communities, and faunal remains represent an invaluable tool to detect such culturally-driven food preferences. In the case of Muslim cultures, faunal assemblages are particularly useful to detect permanent
dietary taboos.
This study investigates meat consumption in Muslim Sicily, with a special focus on the introduction and spread of Muslim food
taboos, most famously that on pork. Faunal assemblages from urban and rural sites were analysed. Zooarchaeological results
show that pork was almost banned from urban centres, where mutton was by far the preferred meat. Intriguing results emerged
from the Sicilian countryside; here, pigs were raised and consumed during the Muslim period, in line with the previous Byzantine
and the following Norman phases. As a result, it seems that the well-known Muslim aversion to pork consumption was not applied
at the same scale in the entire island, suggesting a less intensive cultural pressure in rural areas.
The presentation highlights the key role of zooarchaeology in detecting food taboos, and interpreting them within the wider
archaeological and historical context.
