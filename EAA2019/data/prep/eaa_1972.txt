The current investigation concerns the study of animal bones, not analysed previously, from the “Villa del Casale” and its neighbouring medieval settlement (2004-2013 excavations). The aim of the project was to acquire information about the animal species that used to live in the proximity of the site, the purposes of their husbandry, economic activities, people’s diet, cooking, and
waste disposal. Food is an expression of values and cultural choices; hence, another purpose was to observe the economic and
food changes during the century in which the Villa was occupied.
The paper concerns, in particular, the animal bones from the pits in the area of the Villa and from the pits and the medieval layers
of South Thermal Baths. The bones together with ceramics and other objects testify the most ancient phase of Islamic inhabitation and the life of the settlement in the late Islamic-early Norman period. The research examined in depth various aspects of
economy and diet in several periods of the Villa’s life and how it was gradually changed. It allowed forming a hypothesis about the
status and religion of its inhabitants: a wealthy and self-sufficient Islamic village that changed its status presumably in fear of
the incoming conquerors.
