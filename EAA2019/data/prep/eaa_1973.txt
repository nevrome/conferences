The purpose of Sicily in transition project is to reveal and explain the experience of Sicilian population during periods of regime
change, between the 6th and 13th century AD. As a result of four major transitions, from Byzantine to Aghlabid to Fatimid to
Norman to Swabian, Sicily would have experienced social-economic and religious changes.
This presentation aims to explore the question of Muslim diet and foodways in Sicily at this time. As these transitions and associated impacts are not uniform across Sicily, it is essential to approach this question on a large scale, to ensure we considering
all chronological and regional variabilities. We have taken a diachronic approach, to assess the introduction and different uses of
ingredients that arrived in Sicily at the start of these transitions. We also aim to understand the interaction of different religious
groups within the same site and time. Further to this, we want to compare the lifeways of people within a religious group living in
entirely different settlements, both in Western and Eastern Sicily, such as rural and urban sites, coastal and inland sites. Results
have been obtained through a multi-disciplinary approach using isotopic analysis of human and animal bones and organic residue
