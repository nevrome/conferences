VOLUBILIS

Excavations at Volubilis, 2000-05, have shown that after Roman official withdrawal in the late 3rd century CE, an elite Roman
way of life continued to the 5th century, until destruction by an earthquake. After this, the main centre of the town moved down
slope towards the river, and in the 6th century a Berber enclave was established. This was followed in the 8th century by the
headquarters of Idris I, a descendant of Mohammad, who founded the Idrisid dynasty in the region. Faunal remains from the
excavations indicate a cattle-dominated pattern of animal husbandry and meat diet in the late Roman period, with both sheep/
goat and pig also present in reasonable numbers. The Berber phase sees a diminution in pig percentages, and in the early Islamic
headquarters area the diet is dominated by sheep/goat, with very low cattle numbers and virtual absence of pig. These changes
at Volubilis itself may reflect a more widespread and relatively rapid adjustment of the regional animal economy away from a
mixed cattle-dominated regime to one much more focussed on sheep and goats.
