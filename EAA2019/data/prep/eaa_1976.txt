Presentation Format: Oral
In the 8th and 9th centuries A.D., new settlements, even new cities, emerged in the arid areas of Syria. This is the case of Qasr
al-Hayr al-Sharqi, a site located halfway between Palmyra and the Euphrates. The over 12,000 animal bone remains studied come
from several mudbrick houses and buildings that testify to the exploitation of animals and the meat diet of the inhabitants. A
total of 41 vertebrate species were identified but only 18 were consumed. While the diet is based primarily on sheep and goat
meat, there is evidence that camel, cattle and donkey were also consumed. In addition, hunting and trapping of wild game was
practiced and there is evidence for imported foods. This paper will discuss whether species representation (such as the absence
of pig remains) and the pattern of butchery (species patterning, cut mark type and location) that may offer any unique identifiers
for this early Islamic community.
