Conversion to Islam of the Mongols in the Golden Horde Empire was achieved during the reign of khan Özbäg (1313-1342), and
when the Mongol cities of Old Orhei and Costești existed (14th century), Islam was already practiced at the official state level.
Archaeological evidences in this regard are numerous and conclusive: religious buildings (mosque), coins, funeral inscriptions,
toiletries (bronze mirrors) with Arabic inscriptions, etc.
The Golden Horde domination in the area east from the Carpathians represents the western periphery of the Mongol Empire
and it benefited by “the Mongol peace” starting with the first quarter of the 14th century, until the seventh decade of the same
century.
This study brings together and summaries zooarchaeological research from two archaeological contexts: the Mongol urban sites
of Old Orhei and Costești, both situated in Republic of Moldova.
Animal remains are described in terms of their frequency, quality (size, age and sex), and food-related traditions based on species, body part representation, and butchery patterns.
In the period of Mongolian occupation (Golden Horde) of the two settlements, the main animal species used in the food economy
were sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Capra hircus), cattle (Bos taurus) and horse (Equus caballus), similar to other contemporary Mongolian settlements. Later, after Mongolian retreating, the livestock of the local economy was changed, being mainly represented by
cattle (Bos taurus) and pig (Sus domesticus). The hunting records a very low rate during the Golden Horde period; this is probably
a characteristic of Mongolian big cities.
