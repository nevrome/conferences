EXPERTS AND NON-EXPERTS

Presentation Format: Oral
The history of archaeological exploration on Hadrian’s Wall, the largest World Heritage Site and most researched Romano-British
monument in the UK, is a complex tapestry woven by with threads of expert research and non- expert participation. Early excavations, such as those conducted under the patronage of John Clayton (1843-1890), made use of unqualified yet paid laborers.
Francis Haverfield, considered the founder of Romano British archaeology as an academic subject, recruited unpaid labor supervisors and excavators amongst his own undergraduate students in the early 1900s. Today, the number of volunteers active at 11
Hadrian’s Wall sites and museums outweighs the number of expert archaeological staff, with some volunteers offering financial
contributions to operations in the form of donations or participation fees. In this paper, the relationship between expert and
non-expert participants in archaeological research on Hadrian’s Wall will be explored, with the aim to address the following questions: how has the role of both expert and non-expert participants in research on Hadrian’s Wall evolved from the 19th century to
today? Are today’s non-expert participants comparable to 19th century unpaid labor? Are we, the Hadrian’s Wall experts, involving non-expert participants in the creation of new knowledge, or are we simply respecting the centuries’ old tradition of division
between intellectual and manual labor? Can we (and should we ) overcome the rhetoric of non-expert passive engagement and
steer not only our actions, but also our discourse, in the direction of new forms of active non-expert participation?
