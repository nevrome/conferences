Čunkāni – Dreņģeri cemetery was used during Latvian Middle (5th – 9th c.) and Late (9th – 12th c.) Iron Age by a local tribe – Semigallians. There are 743 inhumations burials excavated (which is only a small part of the probable territory of cemetery), where
both adults and subadults were buried in regular rows according to the same burial traditions – oriented mostly to the NW or SE
and accompanied with grave goods, like ornaments, tools and weapons. Although the majority of the dead were placed next to
each other in regular rows, there are some exceptions where burials’ location is different. Two of these deviant burials were of
young children (burials No. 84 and 89), 2-5-years-of-age. Both burials were located at the bottom of the row, at the feet of several
other subadults and young adults burials, oriented perpendicular to them. Although both subadults were of similar age and their
burials’ deviant location were identical, there were differences within their grave good set – burial No. 84 contained no grave
goods, on the other hand, subadult that was placed within burial No. 89 were given both tools and ornaments, according to the
female grave goods set tradition. It is unclear why these two burials were placed in this unusual location – there are numerous
young children, both with and without grave goods across the cemetery, that are located next to the adults in the same manner,
so why these particular subadults are treated differently? It can be argued that deviant location could be related to the children
different social status, some unusual burial tradition or just simple – economy of space.
