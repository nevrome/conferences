Massive digitalization projects are currently going on in Europe and they have direct consequences for how we work within the
cultural heritage sector. By opening up new digital collections of archaeological material we are making them accessible to everyone. This means that also non-professionals, citizen scientists, can start to use this data.
An undergoing citizen science project called SuALT (The Finnish Archaeological Finds Recording Linked Open Database) is
