ment and design phase of the database, but they will also be the end users of the database, which means that they will produce
the majority of its content.
By engaging the users in a democratic way, we are offering a possibility to make a true impact on the end product. We are currently doing user experience research amongst different stakeholders and end users. Through this research we will be able to ensure
that the database is accessible, easy to use and offers a great experience to its users.
We are aiming for a genuine partnership between the different user groups instead of falling into a merely consultation-like
approach. Our hypothesis, borne out by our UX research data so far, is that learning will be a major motivator for the metal detectorists to use SuALT. By fostering learning we can address some of the problems in this kind of citizen science systems, namely
low quality of metadata.
