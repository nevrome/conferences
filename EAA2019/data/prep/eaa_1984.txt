HERITAGE PROTECTION

Presentation Format: Oral
The NTNU UB, Gunnerus library branch has been running workshops for several years for archaeology, archive students and heritage or Museum professionals in order to map the relationship they consider as important in their study activities when it comes
to climate change or war as a factor for deterioration of heritage monuments. The workshops are based on design methods
whose core philosophy is to include end-users as active participants in the design process and reflect on how we interact, work
and learn in the context of a targeted activity, through observation, discussions, and teamwork so that a concrete idea is produced.
Previous research has suggested that visitors of a cultural heritage site or museum desire interaction and personalization in
exhibits, but others have suggested that successful cases of ‘edutainment’ are far too seldom.
In 2019 we are running a course with engineering students on a masters level at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) who is challenged through a subject called ”Experts in team” to find solutions on how technology can be used to
disseminate History and Archaeology for younger generations and make it more interesting. Issues of authenticity have also
been adressed by the students. The poster is the result of this work.
Including your end users in the process of choosing your strategy can be a way to go for museums and cultural heritage institutions as proposed here.
