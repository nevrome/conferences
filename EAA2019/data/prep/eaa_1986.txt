HERITAGE, ARCHAEOLOGY AND COMMUNITY
Author(s): Mullan, Paul (Heritage Lottery Fund)
Presentation Format: Oral
The National Lottery Heritage Fund, formerly the Heritage Lottery Fund, is the largest funder of heritage in the UK investing more
than £200m each year in heritage projects. Central to that mission has been connecting communities with their heritage. Over
the 20 plus years of the fund’s life archaeology has proven to be a powerful ally to community engagement in heritage through
its ability to involve people and capture their imagination about the past.
This paper will explore how archaeology has been used by HLF projects across the UK, with particular reference to Northern
Ireland. It will show the power of heritage to bring people together and challenge people’s existing assumptions about the past.
It will also show how communities’ engagement in projects can be transformative to those communities sense of their own identity and, in particular, in creating new relationships between communities and their landscapes.
Paul Mullan is the National Lottery Heritage Fund’s Country Director for Northern Ireland. He is currently undertaking PhD research of heritage in a divided society.
