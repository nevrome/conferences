Presentation Format: Oral
Community cohesion, participation and identity, a sense of place and ownership are the core benefits of participation in community archaeology projects. In the often contested landscapes of Northern Ireland, they are a perfect match for the rationale of
Heritage Lottery funded landscape partnerships. They have a unique role in the HLF outcomes of increasing the understanding
of the unique built and cultural heritage through new research, connecting ( reconnecting ) local people to the heritage of their
place, developing heritage skills, understanding of the past ways of life and in turn interpreting the present. This paper from a
community organiser’s perspective, reflects on work at sites in Co’s Tyrone, Armagh, Antrim over the past five years of inclusive
“ bottom-up “ engagement and genuine participation and partnership between the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork at Queen’
University Belfast, the Lough Neagh Landscape Partnership, local councils and above all the local community. It is a powerful,
hands-on method in helping to gain a better understanding of the past and at the same time can lead to a growth in well being
and a sense of belonging.
