PLACING COMMUNITIES AT THE HEART OF COMMUNITY ARCHAEOLOGY: THE EXPERIENCES OF THE
CENTRE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELDWORK
Author(s): Donnelly, Colm (School of Natural and Built Environment, QUB)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork (CAF) is a research and teaching unit based within the School of Natural and Built Environment at Queen’s University Belfast. Established in 2002, the unit comprises a team of nine professional archaeologists
and has completed over 450 archaeological projects. The CAF has also pioneered and facilitated community involvement in
archaeological fieldwork projects across Northern Ireland over the past 16 years, work which has been developed and delivered
through partnerships with a network of public, voluntary and community-based organisations and funders. By engaging with local communities in this manner the CAF has been able to facilitate members of the public - of all ages, backgrounds and abilities
– to participate in archaeological fieldwork, with the professional archaeologists supporting members of a local community as
they examine their past through direct involvement in the programme. The lecture provides an overview of the types of projects
that have been undertaken as we endeavour to place communities at the heart of community archaeology.
