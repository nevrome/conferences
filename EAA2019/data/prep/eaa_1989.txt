NORTHERN IRELAND

Presentation Format: Oral
The growth of community archaeology in Northern Ireland has increased the number of schoolchildren interacting with, and participating in, archaeology projects in the province. These community-based projects are a good way of promoting local heritage,
increasing awareness of archaeological sites, and generating an understanding of archaeology as a profession. At the same
time, there has been increased recognition of the benefits that ‘outdoor learning’ can have on social and academic development. With this in mind, local archaeological sites are a valuable learning resource and well-planned outreach activities which tap
into different aspects of the curriculum have the potential to aid learning and support classroom teaching. This paper will look
at trends noted during recent educational outreach in Northern Ireland and introduce methodologies being trialled to measure
impact. Is participation by schoolchildren on archaeological excavations more than just a nice day out, and can it have a deeper
impact which will benefit participants in the longer term? The Northern Ireland education system, which is largely segregated
down religious lines, provides an additional backdrop for consideration within this discussion.
