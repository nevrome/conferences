CREATING COMMUNITIES: A PUBLIC EXPERIENCE IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Author(s): Baker, Christine (Fingal County Council)
Presentation Format: Oral
Due to the specific Irish legislative framework, community archaeology in Ireland has developed as a hybrid of public outreach,
and community-based projects, each having their own particular opportunities and challenges. Despite the lack of tradition of
direct community engagement with archaeology and the limited opportunities, the public interest in directly engaging with archaeology has increased over the past number of years. Since 2015 Fingal County Council has developed community archaeology projects encompassing collaboration with artists, school-based events, geophysical survey, field walking and excavation,
with the aim of increasing accessibility to the archaeological resource. The model developed in Fingal has not only created a
new community of interested participants from all sectors of society but has created art works, and provided inspiration for
participants to create their own projects (in teaching, tapestry, Irish language) and return to learning. The use of important archaeological sites that had gone out of memory or lacked community awareness has contributed to the place-making, creativity
and community and reclaiming the sense of ownership. This presentation will examine the experience of community archaeology
from the perspective of local government and the community participants.
