Dig Greater Manchester (DGM) was a large archaeological community engagement project operating within Britain during the
years 2011 to 2016. Its scope and scale was designed to assess the real impact of enabling local communities and individuals
to acquire and enhance heritage skills and awareness of heritage-based practices, whilst also contributing the exploration of
the city regionâ€™s experience of industrialisation. At its heart was a core of skills-training that was intended to lead to a legacy of
community involvement once the project was finished. Thus, the project trained through 110 skills-based workshops over 1400
volunteers and engaged on-site with 41 special interest groups, and on-site and in the classroom with more than 3400 school
children, and led to several spin off community projects. This paper looks at the ways in which the Dig Greater Manchester community archaeology project set about recording the impact of the project on individuals and communities. These approaches included a three-strand research design aimed at covering the significance of community archaeology, the practice of community
archaeology and the archaeology of industrialisation. The community impact data was captured through specifically-designed
feedback questionnaires (sample size 210), one-to-one interviews (sample size 24), and the input of psychology researchers
from the University of Salford. The results provide reliable data on how archaeology engagement activities can help to build communities and break down barriers, but also shows areas where engagement approaches are weak amongst certain age groups,
ethnic and social backgrounds.
