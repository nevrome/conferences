In 2014 a 17th century shipwreck was found off the coast of the island Texel, The Netherlands. Divers salvaged numerous finds
from the wreck, including a silk dress and a pair of silk stockings. Information about the finds from the wreck quickly went around
the world and the objects were discussed in detail in the international press.
The silk stockings from the wreck became the centre point of an exciting reconstruction project conducted by the Textile Research Centre in the Netherlands. The aim of the project was to gain knowledge about the production and use of these garments.
To help answer these questions a series of reconstructions was made involving as many as a hundred experienced knitters from
all over the world. These knitters shared their knowledge and craftsmanship with the textile archaeologists who investigated
the stockings.
This paper will focus on how this group of knitters became an essential part of the archaeological research. It shows in what way
both archaeologists as well as craftspeople benefitted from being part of the project and what they learned from each other.
Lastly it aims to offer insight in the lessons learned and best practices for future citizen- or community-science projects in other
areas of archaeology.
