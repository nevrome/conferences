Presentation Format: Oral
The paper will present and contextualise the aims of a new 3-year joint project, CARE-MSoC (Community Archaeology in Rural Environments Meeting Societal Challenges), funded through the European Commission by national research councils in the Czech
Republic, Netherlands, Poland and UK to build capacity in the heritage sector across Europe to help rural communities through
participative community archaeology projects (http://archaeologyeurope.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/). CARE-MSoC will use an approach
which has the advantage for research purposes of being replicable in any rural community: involving residents in small ‘test pit’
excavations within their own villages in order to throw new light on their settlement’s long-term development. This approach has
been shown to achieve a wide range of wider social benefits in the UK (including democratising knowledge, instilling new transferrable skills, raising academic aspirations, increasing social mobility, enhancing self-esteem, extending social networks, enriching lives, connecting people with place and strengthening social cohesion) while also helping protect archaeological remains.
Combining methodologies from archaeology, historical geography, social psychology, digital humanities and medieval studies,
CARE-MSoC aims to explore the precise mechanisms by which these community archaeology project achieve this wider impact,
and use these insights to develop methods for adapting existing approaches to suit different pre-existing circumstances in
different countries.
