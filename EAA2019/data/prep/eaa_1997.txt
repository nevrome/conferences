Opinions and practices in regards to public participation in archaeology vary widely in different countries. While so-called ‘community digs’ and other forms of participation are very common in the UK and volunteering opportunities can be easily found on
the internet, the situation in Germany and Italy is different. Unlike in the UK, all excavations in the two continental European countries require a permit from the respective state heritage agency, due to more restrictive heritage laws and policies. In Germany,
volunteering with the state heritage agencies is possible, but actual community archaeology projects as those common in the
UK are rare. In Italy, public participation in excavations is at present prohibited by the state heritage agency’s current policy, which
restricts volunteers to ‘support activities’ (such as logistics), despite Italy being in the process of ratifying the Faro Convention.
Therefore, archaeologists are forced to find other ways to enable the public to participate in archaeological research.
To identify the challenges that archaeologists have to face when working with the public across Europe and to better understand
professional archaeologists’ attitudes towards public participation and see whether the different laws and policies have shaped
them, a survey was conducted amongst British, German and Italian archaeologists. The results will be presented in this paper.
