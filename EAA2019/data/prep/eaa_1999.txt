identities today. The project, a joint effort between the University of Maryland and Eckley Miners’ Village, an open air museum
that interprets 19th century coal company town life, has a wide following within the local, white, aging population. Although
the local population has always felt a strong affinity to Europe and have consistently defined themselves in accordance with
their ancestors’ European origins, the community archaeology project has unintentionally provided institutional legitimization
for their modern identities as European-Americans. Through inviting community participation in the excavation of the material
culture of 19th century immigrants, we have paved the way for community members to develop deeper connections with Europe
rather than with their own communities. While community archaeology often results in strengthening participants’ sense of
connection to place and building place-identities, in this instance, the archaeological remains of the transnational identities of
the 19th century workers have strengthened participants’ sense of belonging to countries they have never visited. In this paper,
I explore the role of public archaeology in (inadvertently) perpetuating and strengthening imagined communities and the ways
that communities can be adept at adapting the results of community archaeology excavations to serve their own purposes.
