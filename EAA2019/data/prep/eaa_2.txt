PERSPECTIVE

Pastoralism and transhumance are pre-industrial rural practices based on the exploitation of extreme environments for livestock
grazing, in areas that are considered marginal for arable farming. Pastoral practices characterise different mountain regions
(where the vertical gradient generates the proximity of different ecosystems) and are particularly relevant in the socio-economic history of the Alps. It is widely acknowledged that material culture plays an important role in the adaptation of pastoral
groups to mountain landscapes. Accessibility, particularly challenging in montane areas, constrains settlement choices and the
amount of artefacts that pastoralists carry with them. Resource availability leads to the use of specific types of raw material.
And extreme weather conditions have a critical influence on rural architecture. Therefore, in order to understand human-environment interaction at high altitude, a more accurate understanding of the material culture of pastoral groups is necessary.
Ethnoarchaeology provides an ideal perspective to interpret the complex meanings of artefacts and architectures produced and
used by livestock farmers in the Alpine uplands. Building on the results of an ethnoarchaeological project recently carried out in
the Western Italian Alps (EthWAL project), this paper will analyse the materiality of pastoralism in the Alps, with specific attention on adaptive, socio-economic and cultural values of the contexts and objects investigated. This, in turn, will shed new light on
the potential and challenges of archaeological assemblages in mountain contexts for the analysis of ancient pastoral activities.
