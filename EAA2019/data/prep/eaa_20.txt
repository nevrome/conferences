The Norse period of Skye and the Western Isles of Scotland began in the late 8th century AD with the first Viking raids, and ends
in the mid-13th century with the annexation of the islands from the Norwegian crown to the Scottish crown. This Norse period
has traditionally been divided into the Viking Age (790-1087 AD) and the Late Norse period (1087-1266 AD), on the basis of the
historical evidence that shows the creation of the Kingdom of the Isles from 1087 AD. The archaeological material of the period
between 950-1150 AD shows dramatic changes: the foundations of Norse longhouses go from post and turf build to stone built,
Norse pagan burials cease, and many of the pre-Norse monumental structures of the islands were likely reoccupied. Moreover,
the islands themselves were integrated into the Kingdom of the Isles, shifting their geopolitical influence from the Jarldom of
Orkney to the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea region, and Skye became the seat of the Skeabost diocese, under the authority of the
archbishop of Trondheim. In this paper, I will examine the changes that occur in this period through a survey of the archaeological
evidence, and take into consideration the role of religion and ethnicity within a landscape context. In in this paper, I argue that
ethnic, religion and social forces affected the landscape of Skye and the Western Isles during the Norse Period, with an emphasis
on the mid-10th to mid-12th centuries.
