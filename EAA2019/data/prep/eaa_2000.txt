THE ARCHAEOLOGIST WITHIN: AN EXAMPLE OF COMMUNITY ARCHAEOLOGY WITHIN A CONTENTIOUS
SETTING

The Ã…land Islands is an autonomous archipelago in the Baltic Sea. With its 29.000 inhabitants and own legislation concerning the
protection of archaeological sites, archaeology has been a very infected subject matter for decades. This can be said to have culminated in 2013 in a controversial trial and conviction of a family severely and knowingly damaging one of the oldest Stone Age
sites on the islands. On this backdrop, a research excavation project was initiated concerning a Late Iron Age settlement site.
The project had a clear focus on public communication and community archaeology was of prime importance, which is unusual in
the region, where archaeology is highly professionalized. The situation required a custom made strategy implemented over several years. A very active relationship had to be established and maintained with local people. Lots of energy was invested in continuously disseminating the plans, methods, results and interpretations of the project and archaeology in general. An awareness
of the inherently political nature of archaeological communication permeated the setting. Experiences from the project have
highlighted the value of inclusion, transparency and engagement as factors leading to changing attitudes towards archaeology.
Simultaneously, an interesting dichotomy has been revealed between the attitudes of the public and the heritage management
sector, thereby showing that the social dynamics of archaeology itself constitutes a peril when it comes to community oriented
projects such as this.
