HARD ROADS TO TRAVEL: LESSONS LEARNT FROM PRACTICING COMMUNITY ARCHAEOLOGY
Author(s): Sayer, Faye (Manchester Metropolitan University)
Presentation Format: Oral
Over the last few years, Manchester Centre for Public History and Heritage (MCPHH) have developed regional, national and international community archaeology projects with marginalised and disadvantaged communities, and within areas in which archaeology is often disregarded, socially, economically and politically. As such, these projects have employed innovative approaches
to the co-production of historical and archaeological knowledge, and all have had ethical implications for academics and participants, for projects that actively engage the public in archaeology often do so by linking modern day communities to historical
communities, and in the process uncomfortable truths and painful pasts can be uncovered. In order to explore the issues raised
by such work, this paper examines some of the experiences from recent community archaeology projects, including case studies drawn from work in the UK and Nigeria. In doing so, the paper will discuss lessons learnt from these ‘socially engaged’ community archaeology projects, including such issues as dealing with conflicting values, ensuring long-term sustainability, supporting
duty of care, and understanding psychological and emotional risk.
