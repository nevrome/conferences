Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms

Format: Regular session
The socio-theoretical as well as the bio-medical research of recent years has revealed the complexity of the categories «sex»
and «gender». Biological sex is not only shaped on different levels (chromosomal, gonadal, hormonal, epigenetical) but the manifestation of sex characteristics can – because of their polygenic regulation and the variety of influencing factors – be highly
variable. The binary model of the sexes, which is prevalent in many countries of the Western world, represents only one possible
way in which a society may translate the different manifestations of sex characteristics into the cultural sphere of gender. The
category «gender», in the sense of a description of observations about the handling of the dead, mortuary rites as well as any
accompanying artefacts in relation to bio(archaeo-)logical sex indicators – is a central topic of modern archaeological interpretation. The focus of this session lies on the interdisciplinary examination of the implications of these new findings for established
concepts of «sex» and «gender» especially when reflecting those concepts against the backdrop of the social structures of
past societies.
