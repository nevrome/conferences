The ability to determine the sex of a skeletal specimen is an indispensable resource to the field of physical anthropology, as it
provides vital information regarding the demographic composition, death rate, life expectancy, and the burial customs correspondent to each sex. These customs include occupation-based layout patterns in mortuary sites and, crucially, sex-differentiated grave goods. However, in analysing these data, archaeologists often draw conclusions related to the societal roles of
the deceased, creating an area of overlap in which the bioarchaeological, anatomical assignment of sex and the archaeological,
social concept of gender both come into play. Due to this dichotomy, the assumption is that the field of physical anthropology will
be able to provide, definitively, the biological sex of the deceased individual, in order that societal roles may be inferred by archaeologists. This paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of osteological sex determination and asks if physical anthropology really provides the bare facts of a person’s biology, moreover it presents an idea how methodological limitations can be faced.
