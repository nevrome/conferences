OSTEOLOGIC SEX

There is increasing evidence that the concept of two distinct sexes is too simplistic to describe the corporeal reality of the
human experience (Ainsworth, 2015). This poses both methodological and theoretical challenges which call for a critical examination of the archaeological and bioarchaeological tool kits.
Osteoanthropologists use various methods in sexing human skeletal remains. Multivariate discriminant procedures can produce
results within a forensic confidence range. The morphognostic assessment of sex variants , on the other hand, may vary considerably in its reliability. Studies often aim to attribute individuals “securely” to one of two sex categories “male” or “female”, that
is to identify sex unequivocally. This also answers to a particular desire voiced by archaeologists. Assignment of a “probable” or
“the wrong” sex is more often than not ascribed to the uncertainties of the osteologic methodology and the individuals excluded
from further analysis.
In order to evaluate the whole spectrum of sex characteristics in human skeletal remains a new approach to assess osteological
variability is required. By combining the morphologic assessment of characteristics and metric data, one may not only assign
osteologic sex but also assess the corporeality of individuals. The aim is to visualise the nuances of sex differences in a given
sample and to enable new insights into differentiated categories of gender. First results of this complex approach are presented
