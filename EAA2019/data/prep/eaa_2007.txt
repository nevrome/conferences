FORGET ABOUT SEX – LET US TALK ABOUT GENDER
Author(s): Pichler, Sandra L. (IPAS, University of Basel)
Presentation Format: Oral
Its self-perceived positioning in the sciences, chiefly in biology, has long restricted European and especially German speaking
osteoanthropology. With few exceptions, the discipline has generally remained static in its scientific focus and interpretations,
commonly applying a simple binary model of the sexes. Discrepancies between skeletal and archeological sex are usually attributed to the cultural sciences’ perception of gendered objects. Individuals of the in-between categories are regarded as insufficiently distinct rather than constituting the reflections of a nature-nurture continuum. This also applies to recent approaches
like biogeoarcheometric dietary or mobility reconstruction by stable isotope analysis, and even more so to ancient DNA studies.
Addressing the challenges presented by social bioarchaeology in discussions across disciplinary borders creates opportunities
for advancing our concepts of social roles and rules shaping lives and bodies in former communities.
