The most important Scythian necropolises with several women-warriors in the Lower Dnepr Basin (Mamai-Gora, Skel’ki, Ryadovye Mogily), the similar necropolis of the Middle and Late Sarmatian Cultures (Novyi, Vysochino) in the Lower Don Basin and
also the sedentary necropolises of Greeks (Tanais) and Maeotes (Kobyakovo) - which include the Sarmatian wives with weapons
- are analyzed.
The corpses of most of nomadic women of the late 5th c. BCE – the 3rd c. CE who died in the war remained on the battlefield and
did not get to the clan cemetery. At the same time, the women-warriors often occupied a special place of honor in the structure
of the necropolis. The women-warriors in the graves are usually the age of 25-30 years, after long years of marriage. In the more
early age (in period the main military activity, from the age of 12) the weapons are usually absent with them. The placement of the
weapons was, probably, due to two factors: it was associated with special personal military merits in previous years and with the
status of the family (or husband) at the time of the woman’s death. The set of female weapons in each community was different
from the male. The weapons more prestigious than the usual arrows sometimes dependent on age group or from the specific
traditions of the woman’s clan (which used a specific type of graves). The relatives were not keen to place in the grave of the
woman a full range of her weaponry (probably, they sometimes put with the woman their weapon similar to that which she used).
For the socially significant woman to denote her status was sufficient to have the weapons of more rare type (one to four spears
and scaly armor for Scythians; the axe, long sword or three different blades for Sarmatians).
