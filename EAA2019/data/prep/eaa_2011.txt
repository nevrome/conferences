WRITING AND READING ROME IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
Author(s): Ó Ríagáin, Russell (Heidelberg Centre for Transcultural Studies)
Presentation Format: Oral
In contrast to several other nearby regions of Europe, a strong element of Irish national sentiment has been constructed around
the island of Ireland having lain outside the Roman Empire. The treatment received by the Roman world in a series of twentieth-century textbooks intended for secondary school history teaching will be outlined and critiqued, as will the ways in which it
has fed into both popular and academic discourse. It will be discussed how this treatment developed out of a colonial opposition
in which the British Empire was seen as a core territory, progressive and equated with the Roman past and Ireland peripheral and
equated with a timeless barbarian Europe. This opposition was internalised and embraced by Romantic nationalists and pan-Celticists on both islands and has strongly informed post-colonial discourse in Ireland, not least in the education system. Recent
work on Ireland in the late Iron Age and early medieval period has begun to break down this opposition; this paper will close with a
transcultural critique of the main elements of the Roman–Irish opposition, recognising instead, as several recent scholars have,
that the Roman Empire had a strong, if not quite defining, influence on ideological and material cultural practices and the political
changes ongoing in Ireland c.300–600 CE—transculturation, if not Romanisation.
