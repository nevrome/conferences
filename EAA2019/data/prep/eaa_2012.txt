This paper addresses some of the contrasting values attributed to Iron Age and Roman ancient monuments and open-air museums in Britain. The Iron Age and Roman periods often seem to be made to operate in opposition to each other in terms that
have been defined as ‘insistent dualities’, including civilisation - barbarism (Hingley et al. 2018). Iron Age open-air museums with
reconstructed roundhouse are particularly common and these tend to emphasise egalitarian living and outdoor pursuits. They
provide a contrast with the hillforts that are scattered across Britain, which have tended to be interpreted in the context of
warrior elites.
Roman venues are rather more common and include high-profile ancient monuments, forts, fortresses, towns and villas. These
are used to communicate ideas of military identity, social hierarchy, gracious living, progress, order and civilisation. Such concepts, evidently, fit the Romanisation agenda that was heavily critiqued by archaeologists and ancient historians during the
1990s.
These Iron Age and Roman values are tied in with the school education agenda in England which emphasises the progress of
Roman civilisation, downplaying the significance of the Iron Age. The Iron Age open air museums have been developed, in part, to
counter this Romanocentric conception. Exploring the values inherent in conceptions of the Iron Age and Roman past emphasises the potential to tell additional tales about violence, assimilation, population mobility and forced incorporation.
How are these messages to be addressed in school education, where the main emphasis is upon positive images and messages
from the past? Is portraying the past as preferable to the present an entirely helpful approach in the current climate?
