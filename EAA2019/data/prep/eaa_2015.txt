After the fall of Constantinople, Mehmed II adopted the title Kayser-i Rûm, claiming succession to the Roman Imperium. This title
was then used by many Ottoman sultans for centuries, employing it as an insult against their European rivals. In the 19th century,
the Ottoman sultans ceased using this title – and identifying with the Roman past – as the first Ottoman archaeologists began
to study the Roman heritage of the Ottomans. During the Republican Period of Turkey, the Roman past and its archaeology played
a crucial role for Turkish political manoeuvres against Italy, a nation-state identifying as “the Third Rome”, or the presumed successor of the legacy of ancient Rome. In this newly developed and politically charged political climates, Hittites were considered
to be the founding fathers of Anatolian Turkey, a concept that was developed vis-a-vis Italy’s New Rome. Within this context, the
Roman past of Turkey was reformulated with deep roots in Anatolia after the 1960s, with Ekrem Akurgal’s theoretical approaches that clearly had a nationalistic agenda. In the 21st century, Turkish archaeologists, Ottoman historians and other intellectuals
began to criticize the politicalization of Anatolian Roman past. Research on Roman Anatolia was popular, paving the way for new
approaches in archaeology, and contributing to the politics on how Anatolia’s Roman past was displayed in Turkish museums and
perceived in history and archaeology. After a short survey of the role the Roman past held in the late Ottoman and early Republican periods, this paper will discuss recent political dynamics, focusing in particular on the criticism of the Roman past in 21st
century Turkey.
