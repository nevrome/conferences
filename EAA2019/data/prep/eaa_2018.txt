Romania is a country named for its Roman past. When the modern nation-state was founded in the mid-19th century, its inhabitants were believed to be the living descendants of the Romans who ‘civilised’ Dacia in the 2nd century CE. Approaches to the
study of the past in Romania evolved alongside the national narrative—during the early 20th century the indigenous Dacian element began to assert itself concurrent to the advent of cultural-historical archaeology, and presently the Daco-Roman continuity thesis remains with micro-supports for Romanian nationalism embedded into research. There is a growing movement in Romanian archaeology for an increasing critique and awareness of the impact of politics, but the establishment remains entrenched.
This paper explores the history of Roman archaeology in Romania from the 19th century to the 21st century, examining how the
discourse of the Roman past both creates and sustains the nation. It argues that the adopted of new theoretical approaches in
Romanian archaeology are frequently related to wider political developments.
