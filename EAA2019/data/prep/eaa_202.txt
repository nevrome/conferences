Many archaeological research projects today are interdisciplinary and combine different research traditions, questions, perspectives, and types of data. Such an approach is indispensable when answering complex questions; however, it also necessitates a complex working practice. Combining and correlating the results from various disciplines as well as representing them
appropriately can be especially challenging.
How to overcome these challenges of combining different scales and kinds of data is a major point for discussion. Research at
the micro-scale like soil micromorphology, phytolith analysis or palynology provides unique insights into archaeological sites or
landscape archives. However, such observations usually are based on samples of a few square centimetres. But are they really
representative for an entire layer, profile or even for a whole site or landscape? More generally, how can data that has been gained
at a microscale be transposed onto a meso- or even macroscale, and how can results originating from different disciplines be
correlated?
This introductory lecture gives an overview of the topic and the questions of the session.
