THE POWER OF THE INVISIBLE. DISCUSSING SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
TRANSFORMATIONS IN TEXTILE PRODUCTION
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes
Organisers: Sabatini, Serena (University of Gothenburg) - Fulminante, Francesca (Bristol University)
Format: Regular session
The study of textile production during the Bronze Age and Iron Age has suffered from a lack of scholarly attention. There are
several reasons for this, including the dearth of physical evidence in the form of substantial examples of ancient textiles, as
well as the prevalence of traditional assumptions that regard the tools, such as those used for spinning and weaving, as lacking
historical significance. The situation has now changed, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated that Bronze Age and
Iron Age textile manufacture in Europe and the Mediterranean has, to a great extent, been a part of large-scale and well-organized production systems, whose outcomes were traded and consumed over vast areas, nourishing long-distance networks and
resulting in the flourishing of distinct local economies. It is argued that textile production not only played a relevant economic
role, but also that economic and technological transformations related to such productions represented factors that likely contributed to the development of contemporary transformations, and eventually crises.
The participants in this session will be asked to discuss the evidence for economic and technological transformations related to
textile production, and to consider the cultural, political and environmental impact it had. Archaeologically, we can study differences over time, assessing the quantity and characteristics of:
•
textile tools
•
sheep bone assemblages suggesting wool production
•
pollen diagrams showing the cultivation/presence of specific fibres
In this session we will discuss such changes in the light of the political, social and environmental transformations that may be
