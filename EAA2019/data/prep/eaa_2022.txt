Wool textile production is impossible without sheep. However, the life of sheep and their prerequisite to thrive are invisible in
textile studies. Sheep are sentient beings with the capacity to act as co-domestic beings and as such, co-creators of shared
human-animal lifeworlds. Today and in the past, sheep are important animals in terms of social life, resource management and
transhumance. This paper considers how humans and sheep share a deep history of co-domestic traditional ways of living in
Western Norway that goes back to the introduction of sheep in the Middle Neolithic until present day. Management practices of
sheep include a wide variety of material culture, which is a result of primary and secondary product strategies, and spans textiles, architecture and the ecosystems of pastures. Activities linked to the procurement of these products are social activities,
which create knots of sheep-human-materiality leading to embodied products and practices.
The project that will be presented in the paper examines and documents past practices of co-domestic human-sheep lifeways
and deathways - how past societies and past human-sheep practices have interwoven sheep, materiality and humans in similar
and different ways. The paper discusses how such perspectives might be implemented in Bronze Age and Migration Period case
studies incorporating grazing regimes and textile work.
