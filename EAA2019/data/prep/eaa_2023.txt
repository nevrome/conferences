The aim of this paper is to assess characteristics and scale of pastoral economy and sheepherding at the Terramare settlement
of Montale, Modena province, northern Italy. Previous studies have argued that Montale was the likely home of a Bronze Age
centre of wool production. Evidence to such assumption to be found in the astonishing number of textile tools, in particular
spindle whorls, documented at the site. The presence of large numbers of sheep/goats bones among the local faunal remains
suggests that wool was the main manufactured fibre. The purpose of this paper is to contrast archaeological and archaeozoological data from the site’s internal chronological sequence, with data from other neighbouring sites of the Po valley. It seems
that Montale’s wool economy might have played an essential role as to the local response to wider political, economic, and not
least environmental transformations that distinguish rise, development, and collapse of the Bronze Age Terramare communities
of the Po plain.
