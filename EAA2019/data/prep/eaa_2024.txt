Goal of this paper is to test a new approach to analyse textile tools from survey data and investigate its potential to provide a
complementary perspective to that provided by site excavation and funerary data, to assess the value and spatial distribution
of textile production.
We will use central Italy and central Greece as case studies and we test the association of textile tools with different type of
contexts (urban vs rural) and different types of sites (primary centre, secondary, centre, villa, rural site, cult site etc.).
First, we will discuss the methodological issues linked to such an approach: can textile-related surface data be reliable? How can
surface textile tools be dated and related to a particular phase of the site? Since they are usually low in number, can we rely on
them as for the definition of site-function or the detection of patterns? At what extent is the record biased by post-depositional
factors?
Secondly, we will present results of preliminary analyses by comparing two different regional case studies, central Italy and
central Greece, in the wider context of other regional and/or local analyses. While there is a number of issues and limitations of a
similar approach still some interesting trends can be detected.
Finally, we will evaluate potential issues and advantages of such an approach and its potential for future applications.
