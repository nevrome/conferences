The paper aims to discuss a corpus of inscribed loom weights from the Iron Age settlement of Monte Loffa in the Verona mountains, providing an interesting connection between weaving and writing. The settlement was a central place in the organization
of the mountain landscape of the Late Iron Age. Animal husbandry and weaving played a very important role at the site. Additionally, it is possible to hypothesise that particular fibres were specifically farmed for textile production.
The Raetic area, which covers roughly the central and eastern Alpine region, has given inscribed textile tools: needles, spools,
spindles, whorls and loom weights. This paper focuses on possible connections among writing, weaving and social organization.
Moreover, a comparison will be made with the neighbouring Venetic culture. It is argued that differences in textile tools are possibly to be understood as connected to the use of different fibres, and to the existence of a different social and political organization. Finally, an attempt will be made to trace economic and technological changes related to the Iron Age textile production
in north-eastern Italy during the centuries.
