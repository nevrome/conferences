URBANITAS – EXPLORING URBAN WAYS OF LIFE IN THE PAST AND IN THE PRESENT
Theme: Global change and archaeology
Organisers: Fulminante, Francesca (Bristol University) - Sabatini, Serena (University of Gothenburg)
Format: Regular session
Urbanism in the past and present remains hotly debated in academia and the media (e.g. Copenhagen Polis Centre project; Reception of the City in Late Antiquity ERC Cambridge project; UrbNet Aarhus project; Social Reactors Colorado Project; OIKOS
Dutch network; Guardian Cities in the UK media). These primarily focus on city macro-structures, such as their political, social
and economic organization and/or their monumental aspects.
They pay less attention to the experiences of the individuals and their well-being, which is also a measure of economic growth,
despite that cities exist because of the individuals who live and work in them. With this session we aim to address the more
intimate aspects of city life in developing urban contexts, exploring where and how people live, eat, travel, and interact. Uniting
the past with the present, it asks explicitly:
•
How does people’s life change as communities become increasingly urban?
•
What are the health differences between urban and rural populations and/or people of different social status?
Past developing urban contexts provide a diachronic laboratory to assess different socio-economic factors to determine how
and why urban environments came into being, developed, flourished and collapsed (or not). Thus, they offer data and interpretations for policy makers and stakeholders today to address the Sustainable Cities and Healthy Communities challenges, two of
the 17 global challenges set by the United Nations for a global sustainable development.
