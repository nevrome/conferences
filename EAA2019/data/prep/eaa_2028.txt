The Bronze Age in Southeast Iran lasted from the 3rd till the middle of 2nd millennium BC and has not been recognized in full
potential in Iranian archaeological literature. There are massive amounts of discoveries from that period and region. However, the
reason for the under-representation of the Bronze Age of South East Iran is the disparate evolution of Iranian research interests
during the past 150 years onwards.
The region of Sistan has ever since been a suitable place in Bronze Age for human habitation due to the Hirmand river system and
the fertile Ramroud river delta. From the 3rd millennium BC, onward many sites are established and prospered during the Bronze
Age leading to early urbanization of specific important settlements. Trade and relations with regions in nowadays Afghanistan,
Iran Baluchestan, Central Asia, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley are testified by shared cultural events and material culture.
The site of Shahr-i-sokhte, dating from 3200 till 1800 BC, is a good example of a proto-urban community in Sistan during the
Bronze Age gaining a profound role in trade and exchange within its region and maintaining long-distance connections. In this
paper, I will present significant characteristics of urban life in Shahr-i-sokhte, which can be distinguished into a residential and
workshop quarter. Based on burial data the social stratification and the relations between common and aristocratic people will
also be discussed. The interaction and relations to neighboring settlements and regions are of crucial importance to understand
the rise and fall of Shahr-i-sokhte.
