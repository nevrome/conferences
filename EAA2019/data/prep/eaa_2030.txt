URBANISM AND ETHNICITY IN ANCIENT CENTRAL ITALY
Author(s): Bradley, Guy (Cardiff)
Presentation Format: Oral
This proposal takes as a starting point Torelliâ€™s observation that archaic Rome, like the contemporary Etruscan centre of Volsinii,
can be described as a frontier city. Cities in ancient central Italy emerge as places of interaction, meetings, and also mobility.
Ancient cities are not like modern nation states, which might aspire to have monoethnic populations: well-known ancient examples include classical Athens with its metics and late Republican Rome with its substantial immigrant population. But the
prehistory of this diversity is underestimated, and the pervasive mobility of urban populations is being increasingly appreciated.
Archaeological and epigraphic evidence is revealing how mobility and migration are common for all social classes in cities such
as archaic Rome, which emerge as places where separate ethnicities appear and perpetually interact. This talk considers what
insights the archaeology of central Italian cities offers in this perspective, in terms of cities as living spaces, as bounded areas,
and as permeable structures.
