that is well known in the research field of modern urbanism but has not yet received much attention within medieval archaeology.
The paper proposes that some of the social mechanisms associated with modern urban life might be valid also for life in medieval
and ancient towns. This is discussed with material remains of daily life in the early phases of medieval Copenhagen, Denmark,
as a point of departure. How would people living in the “new” town have experienced life there – was it different from rural life,
and if so, in what ways? The increased social interfaces related to the practical conditions of living in medieval towns, such as
economic specialisation, restricted living space, co-location and daily cooperation with strangers, are bound to have affected
people in their daily routine of life, as well as psychologically. With Copenhagen as example, it will be proposed how archaeology,
with tools from phenomenology and Social Practice Theory can use material culture to discuss how the social consequences of
living in towns has been an important factor in the development of medieval urbanity.
