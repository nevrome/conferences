Medieval Trondheim is the subject of several ongoing and completed studies, particularly pertaining to the health and lifestyle
of its population. The city was founded in 997 CE by Olav Tryggvason, and since then has served as the capital of Norway until
1217 CE and the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros (Trondheim) until the reformation in 1537 CE. It has experienced
considerable fluctuations in population size, experiencing an all time low after the arrival of the Black Death in 1349 CE. Previous
osteoarchaeological analysis on the Folkebibliotekstomten (or st. Olav) cemetery has identified changes in frequencies of lesions associated with physiological stress over time, and has found the urban settlement type to have a significant relation with
bioarchaeological indicators of health. This poster will present bone mineral density (BMD) data gathered on the same collection
using a peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) scanner. Several paleopathological studies have already analysed the relation between
BMD and lifestyle in past urban and rural populations in England, Norway and Italy. Data for the current study was collected
from 88 adult individuals from the Folkebibliotekstomten dating between 1100 and 1650 CE. Patterns in BMD loss between age
groups, sex, and throughout time will be assessed in connection to previous findings on health, to provide a better understanding
of the demands of the urban lifestyle on the population of Medieval Trondheim.
