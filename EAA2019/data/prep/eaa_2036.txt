other elements are mirrored on both sides of central «tree of life» and arranged in decreasing order. There are several variants of
compositions. Often only stylized «trees» are depicted. Usually there are 7 of them and each has axial symmetry. In some cases
trees alternate with animals or birds. Animals (deer, lamb, wolf, as well as fantastic animals like unicorns) or birds (duck, rooster,
peacock, and dove) are depicted in profile and create a rhythmic movement directed toward the center. Most often the composition consists of 5 «trees» and 4 animals or birds. Of particular interest are three forehead bands on which the «trees» alternate
with complex dynamic animal combat scenes. Each hairnet is unique and is a fine example of Russian decorative and applied art.
