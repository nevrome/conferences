Since the 17th century pine tar and its derivative pitch were two vital commodities for building and maintenance of wooden
sailing ships and thus, both substances were in great demand in global markets. Finland, at that time part of Swedish Kingdom,
was rich in forest resources and quickly became an important producer of tar and pitch, which was made by boiling tar. The pitch
cookery of the town of Oulu was established in 1640’s and located on an offshore island, Pikisaari, just across the water from the
urban area. The mill area was inhabited year-round by several pitch burners and their families, who formed a small and intimate
industrial community. This paper investigates everyday life of the pitch mill community during the early modern time by analyzing
material culture and archive materials. A synthesis of various sources has given a new insight into community’s daily life in developing urban-industrial context. It seems, that although the processes of modernization, as well as urbanization started to impact
the pitch mill community’s day to day life, they still engaged with the traditional way of life fusing the early modern conceptions
of the world to modern ones.
