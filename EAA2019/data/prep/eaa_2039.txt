The 16th and 17th centuries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL) were characterised by a period of intense political, economic
and social decline. As if surviving wars, crop failures, and famine was not enough, growing-up became even more challenging.
The bioarchaeology of children is becoming established in archaeology as a sensitive barometer of population health, yet limited
research in this area has been carried out in Lithuania to date. This study compares Lithuanian populations living in urban and
rural environments to examine whether differences in environment impacted on childhood growth and health. The urban sample
(40 non-adults, 20 adults) derived from two cemeteries in the capital city Vilnius (Maironio str. and Subaƒçiaus str.), while the
rural sample (31 non-adults, 10 adults) was excavated from Ramybes str., Alytus, a small town the size of a large village, located
109 km to the south-west of the capital. Growth profiles (long bone length and vertebral dimensions) of urban and rural samples
were compared, together with the prevalence of non-specific stress markers (dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH), cribra orbitalia,
periosteal bone reactions) and frequency of metabolic disease (rickets and scurvy).
Possibly due to the limited sample size, significant differences were not observed between the two samples. However, palaeopathological analysis suggested that rural non-adults were exposed to more harmful life conditions than their urban peers.
