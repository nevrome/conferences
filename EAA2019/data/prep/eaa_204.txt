main periods of occupation were distinguished: the developed Eneolithic (first half of fifth millennium BC), the late Eneolithic
(second half of fifth millennium BC) and the Early Bronze Age (the second and third quarters of the fourth millennium BC). The cultural layers attributable to the Atlantic period of the Holocene developed under conditions of a rather dry climate with domination
of grass-forbred vegetation with a small proportion of tree species. The settlement area was above the flood water level and was
suitable for habitation. Micromorphological analysis shows that the fine material in the cultural layers is clayey-calcareous. The
carbonates with clay are overlain with clayey-ferruginous material. Some fragments of calcareous shells are also quite distinct in
the overlying material. Evidently, that was a case of two-phase formation of the fine material in the cultural layers. The Subboreal
and Subatlantic periods were more humid and cool in whole. In the spore-pollen spectra the proportion of tree species increased,
in the phytolith spectra the meadow cereal phytoliths prevailed. Micromorphology shows that fine material in the latest layers
of the settlement is completely free of carbonates, clayey-Fe in composition, and mottled with spots and nodules of iron compounds. Such microstructure is typical of medium (not superficial) horizons of Meadow Chernozems (Stagnic Chernozems) that
develop under conditions of a leaching water regime. For the studied settlement it means that floods became regular, people
could not live for a long time in this place.
