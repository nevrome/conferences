Larger vertebral dimensions, which hint at lower levels of stress in infancy, and higher prevalence of DEH in the urban sample
suggest that urban children possibly had better opportunities to survive and recover after stressful episodes. In times of turmoil, the whole population was affected and rural populations were as susceptible to health insults as urban communities. These
data raise doubts about the conventional contrast between ‚healthy‘ rural and ‚unhealthy‘ urban living environments for children
in the past.
