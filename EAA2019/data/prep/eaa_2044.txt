Archaeology is useful to address current issues in many ways. On a theoretical level there are different ideological standpoints
when researching the subject: political perspectives on archaeology, such as anarchist archaeology, feminist archaeology, queer
archaeology, etc.
However, to make forgotten people visible, we need projects at a practical level too. In my presentation I want to highlight two
examples of such archaeological resistance:
1. The work that CRAS (Revolutionary Center of Social Archaeology) is carrying out, especially at a feminist level with exhibitions
and archaeological activism with the objective of saving our heritage from companies that want to destroy archaeological sites
to build supermarkets, roads, etc.
2. The special case of how archaeology can serve as a form of rural resistance. Fraguas is a repopulated hamlet in Guadalajara
(Spain) which was occupied and rebuilt by young people in accordance with the traditional architecture of the area. According
to the law, they could be prosecuted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for squatting in an alleged forest area which has never
been inhabited, however, the Backset Archaeology Association studied one of the buildings, a church, to justify that Fraguas
was a village which was abandoned in 1968, so it could not be classified as a forest area. Due to this archaeological research, the
occupiers sentence may be reduced.
