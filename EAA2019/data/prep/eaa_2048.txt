Presentation Format: Oral
Despite living in the ‘Estado Novo’ (‘New State’), during the 1960s a succession of internal and external political episodes justified public demonstrations - especially student ones -, against the political regime in force for several decades. Like any other
science, archaeology was not untouched by this movement, and it tried to innovate in teaching, bibliographical access, training
abroad, interpretation and the presentation of data collected in the field and examined in the laboratory.
Some of these aspects have already begun to be analyzed by those who devote themselves to the history of archaeology. Others, however, are only beginning to be studied now, like the subject of women in archaeology. It is in this sense that we propose
to examine how the feminine element has been presented in these two decades in archaeological narratives - written and iconographic -, in order to understand how the social model prevailing at the time was transcribed in and reinforced by them, and to
what extent archaeologists and the public were aware of this process. Last but not least, we will try to compare the reality found
in primary and secondary sources to that observed today, reflecting on the role of archaeology in education for citizenship and
equality.
