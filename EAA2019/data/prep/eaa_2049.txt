Have gender studies succeeded in creating or participating in discourses of resistance within archaeology or are they part of the
counter-discourse necessary to validate the current androcentric narrative? Can gender studies be a subversive framework, or
(auto)critical inspiration (after Bourdieu, 1998), within archaeology.
Many studies, while rendering “women” visible, continue to define them by their association with domestic tasks. And although
the private (the house) has been lit up and the discussion of gender preconceptions forced into the public, the traditional architectural dichotomy still sustains the social norms of male dominance. Also, within prehistory, the link between biological sex and
gender is difficult to undo, gender being intertwined with the duality of biological sex. As such, we are forced to ask the question,
is it possible to reach gender beyond biological sex, insofar as it is in permanent construction and dependent on interpersonal
relationships? Or is it just another category that limits our interpretation?
This paper aims to question the repercussions of gender studies in Prehistory, with special focus on Iberian Late Prehistory, and
to re-evaluate the concept of gender in the production of discourses must be more inclusive, responsible and fair to the otherness of the prehistoric past, taking into account the questions raised above.
