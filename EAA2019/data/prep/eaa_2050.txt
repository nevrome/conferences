One of the many faces of the changing global political climate in the past few years has been the backlash against the social
progresses achieved in the matter of both woman’s rights and the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Neo-conservative, populist and
far-right political movements have deployed the narrative of “gender ideology” as a resource to mobilize their social and electoral
bases around a reactionary view of gender and sexuality which threatens to undo decades of advancement towards greater
equality and a fairer and more open society. The Social Sciences and the Humanities, which helped to achieve those progresses
by offering a theoretical underpinning to social movements and grassroots activism, have been directly targeted by this backlash but have also become an active field of resistance against it.
Despite a certain epistemological marginalization within this wider knowledge field, Archaeology has a clear potential to make
theoretical and practical contributions to this discussion. The experience of Feminist and Gender Archaeology with standpoint
theory and “strong objectivity” can certainly be useful in building defenses against the rise of “post-truth”. Furthermore, its
wide geographical and chronological scope make it a privileged field to explore the historical construction of gender and sexual
norms, a key task if the essentialism and appeal to tradition underpinning current reactionary narratives are to be critically deconstructed.
However, to do so, Archaeology needs to shed a certain reluctance regarding socio-political engagement, as well as to exploit its
clear interdisciplinary vocation in a more proactive way, endeavoring to make active contributions to on-going discussion rather
than just draw from them.
