In recent decades, many archaeologists have called out for the decolonization of archaeology as a scientific discipline and as a
social practice. These calls recognize that knowledge production is contingent on power relations and that, historically, archaeology emerged as a practice at the service of colonialism and nationalism. The decolonization of archaeology has shown that there
are other histories to tell about groups and events that were traditionally relegated to the margins of knowledge and power and
that, by doing so, archaeology became a tool of social justice. However, the conversation about the decolonization of archaeology in Europe has been marginalized as well. In this paper, we will discuss the need to decolonize European archaeology. We will use
three case-studies from Portugal, which simultaneously show the need to decolonize archaeology and the social possibilities
that arise from the process. The cases are: the deconstruction of power relations within the profession, the study of slavery, and
the emergence of contemporary archaeology in the context of the current European humanitarian crisis.
