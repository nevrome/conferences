RATIONAL, EMPIRICAL AND ROMANTIC PREHISTORIES

At a critical moment in European history, Gordon Childe reflected that “it can hardly be alleged that Prehistory is a useless study”,
since it was within this discipline that theories of racial identity and population history were constructed and contested. As he
noted, “in the name of these theories men are being exiled from public life and shut up in concentration camps”. By an unfortunate
coincidence, the return of racism and authoritarianism to European politics coincides with a renewed interest in massive population movements. In the 1990s, Andrew Sherratt introduced an influential interpretation of the development of archaeological
thought, in which the discipline lurched between episodes of Enlightenment rationalism and Romanticism. One argument is that
notions of ‘peoples’ as homogeneous expressive totalities can be attributed to the latter. Accepting the value of Sherratt’s argument, I seek to modify it, by suggesting that the essential tension in the history of archaeology has been between empiricism and
rationalism. As Isaiah Berlin observes, totalitarianism is as likely to emerge from an excess of rationality as from Romanticism.
