Almada was a medieval fortified village located in the south bank of the Tagus River opposite to Lisbon. Although the area is
occupied since pre-historic times only in the 11th century there is news of a fortification. Not that much is known from this initial
period, however, in the 13th century, after the Christian Reconquista it is already a fortified village with at least two churches,
a number which will increase in the following centuries with news of additional churches within its walls and several religious
buildings (churches, monasteries and hospitals). This panorama will be consistent until 1755 when an earthquake destroys a
large portion of the village.
This paper aims to discuss the urban organization of this village in medieval and early modern times relating its castle, city walls
and religious buildings and how urban organization choices were made having in mind military, political and religious powers. The
presence of these buildings still shapes the urban organization of the area today. On the other hand we will try to understand the
role of this village in a more widespread zone locating other religious houses and churches in the nearby areas outside the city
walls, discussing how were all of these buildings related and how did they influence the landscape of that area.
