Presentation Format: Oral
Together with the great transformations of 12th/early 13th centuries in the north-western Slavic lands (nowadays North-Eastern Germany), including Christian mission in until then pagan tribal areas of the Lutician league, the first monasteries emerged.
In still not fully christianised lands and sometimes troubled atmosphere, these monasteries were founded often in the shelter of
princely strongholds, often also near early urban fortified centres to develop religious and political influence. The location of the
monasteries depended on the character of the order, on its specific mission and also on the time of foundation, because religious
and political affairs in these times rapidly changed. Thus, there was a very specific relation between the strongholds as centres
of power and the monasteries as centres of Christian faith in nowadays North-Eastern Germany. This relation is studied based
on archaeological and historical approaches, focussing on Uckermark region in Brandenburg (the former area of Slavic Ukrane
tribe, afterwards Pomeranian duchy) and the relation of Fergitz island stronghold and Cistercian Nuns monastery of Seehausen
in 12th/13th century.
