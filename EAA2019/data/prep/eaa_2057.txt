Presentation Format: Oral
In Lower Saxony there are about fifteen large Cistercian monasteries, some of which were very influential in the Middle Ages and
even beyond the region. Examples are Amelungsborn, Hude, Ihlow, Loccum, Riddagshausen and Walkenried.
The amount of research carried out thus far on these monasteries varies considerably: from modern archaeological excavations
with differing degrees of site coverage, to architectural or individual building survey. Consideration of the integration of the
monasteries within their surrounding landscapes has only been analysed to a very limited extent.
This paper provides an overview of the research carried out to date and - based on the results obtained - pays tribute to the
paradigms of this work. Considering the perspectives of a landscape archaeological investigation for the first time, however, the
monasteries of Amelungsborn, Loccum and Walkenried will be discussed. The paper focuses on the build of the monasteries in
relation to pre-existing settlement structures, and to what extent, if at all, these structures were used in the foundation of the
monasteries.
