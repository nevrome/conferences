This contribution introduces differences and parallels in the construction forms of the fortified churches in European regions.
Special attention will be paid to the comparison between fortified churches in Central Europe and Iberian Peninsula. These
churches serviced not only for the Christian liturgy, but they functioned additionally as a place of the active defence, a place
where people found protection during wars or local fights in their region. In some churches were also specially constructed places for the hiding of the rare and expensive objects or keeping guns for example in towers.
This presentation will show also different elements of the defence, which should be divided to two main groups â€“ active and
passive. The first group includes loophole, to the second group belong for example walls and towers with gates or fortress moats.
Other components are related to the construction of the church itself as narrow windows, massive walls, bolts in the church
doors.
This topic is not very often reflected in the research, although it is crucial for the proper knowledge of all types of the military
architecture in the Middle Age in Europe.
