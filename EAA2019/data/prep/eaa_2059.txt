Transylvania (central-western Romania) retains a considerable treasure of fortified churches scattered throughout its territory. Religious spaces combined with elements of fortification had already appeared in the 11th-12th, but most of the fortified
churches were completed or built in the 15th-16th centuries. This phenomenon was not entirely unique in medieval Europe, as
similar isolated structures were erected in various other places, but nowhere did it reach the same magnitude as in Transylvania.
This situation may be explained by the position of this province on the eastern side of the Carpathian basin, at the forefront of
Tatar and, then, Ottoman attacks.
From the outside a fortress, from the inside a church and, most often than not, a Romanesque or a Gothic jewel: the characteristics of a fortified church may reveal such a stark contrast between them that they surprise not only visitors, but also specialists
who attempt to reconstruct the history of these architectural monuments.
This paper will give an overview of fortified churches in south-eastern Europe, examining the phenomenon in a broader context.
