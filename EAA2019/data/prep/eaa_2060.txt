The Königsberg castle (now it is a city of Kaliningrad) was founded in 1255. West wing in a Renaissance style and towers of the
castle were constructed in 1584-1591. The castle was ruined in 1944-1945 and later its ruins were taken apart.
Archaeological excavations of 2016 in near 1790 sq.m. area were held on the territory of the west wing.
A basement of the north-west tower of 2,5 meters high and mortared bond of bricks and boulder were revealed. Bricks of the XVI
century were 29 x 14 x 8 - 31 x 13 x 7 cm in size. Bricks from demolished old walls were used as well. The tower foundations were
based on wooden stilts drowned in clay along with gothic foundations made out of broad boulders fastened with clay.
The cultural layer contained early findings like silver coin with a portrait of Albert of Brandenburg, a key with laced head and amber
bead as well. A level containing ceramics of Order period without late materials was revealed under which there was another level
containing moulded ceramics except for kitchenware made using pottery wheel.
A rectangular building and round towers were found here: two towers of large diameter on the side of the moat and two towers
of small diameter for the stairs on the side of the courtyard.Old Stuttgart Castle constructed a little earlier had the most alike
analogies to the west wing of the Königsberg castle in building stacking plan. Similar architectural and construction concepts
can be found in castles constructed in a Renaissance style in Holland, France and Sweden as well.
