research needs to be done in order to manage the cultural heritage and to achieve optimal results.
In the present scenario sustainable tourism has become an important challenge to deal with particularly in the age of modernization. Conventional tourism plans are dominated by the growth requirements of the tourism industry while sustainable tourism
plans are based on a wider, more holistic and regional analysis.
To understand the scope and reach of sustainable heritage tourism, a case study of Bishnupur in Bankura district in eastern India
has been chosen. The present study aims to highlight the strategies, opportunities and challenges for developing sustainable
tourism specifically in the heritage sites through this case study. The materials have been collected through the field work in this
region. Some important but lesser known heritage sites have been selected for this study.
