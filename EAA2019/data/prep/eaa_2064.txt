39.2 million overseas visitors who came to the UK in 2017 spent £24.5 billion – both setting records. These figures represent a
4% increase in volume and 9% (nominal) increase in value compared with 2016.
The National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland had 26.6m visitors in 2017/18 and reached 5.2m members while in
1970s there were only 270,000 visitors, while the National Trust for Scotland had 2,480,000 visitors to its properties in 2014/15
and 330,000 members joined this charity. The number of people employed by these two conservation charities is over 10,000
and over 65,000 volunteers contribute to the upkeep of British heritage.
Any site in the care of these two charities can be at risk of mass tourism exploitation – especially flagship sites such as Stonehenge – however both charities rely on a site network operational system which encourages visitors to widen their interests and
therefore enable to absorb this high number of visitors. The risks are mitigated locally and regionally by promoting on-site and
off-site not only flagship sites but also satellite sites that can thus benefit from the presence of well-known nearby sites.
This paper is going to explore the operational system adopted by the National Trust for Scotland and the National Trust, investigating pros and cos of a centralised operational model, focusing on the financial sustainability, the conservation risk, benefits
to local communities, and whether it is acceptable to consider visitor numbers and high revenues as parameters of a successful
season.
