of cultural heritage. Currently, a constant development concerning the cultural routes is observed in an international level during
the last decades, as it is widely accepted that cultural tourism has an important role in the world touristic industry.
Regarding the study of cultural routes in Greece as a multidimensional concept the following concerns have arisen: Firstly, we
are concerned about the general impact of cultural routes at local and national level and specifically in the economic sector.
Moreover, we deal with the concerns regarding the natural environment and we delve into the educational aspect of cultural
routes in Greece. In addition, the audience we aim at is both specific and broad and we put forward the institutional framework
of the study. Finally, we conduct the development and planning of new cultural routes, having in mind the museums as both the
starting and ending point of a route.
