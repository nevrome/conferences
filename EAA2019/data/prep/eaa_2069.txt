Presentation Format: Oral
In the last few years the city of Naples, whose city center is listed as UNESCO heritage site is living a very important increasing of
tourist presences. The increasing of tourists presences is effecting not just the city of Naples, but also its surroundings, where
there are relevant and very fragile heritage sites such as Herculaneum and Pompeii. The arrival of so many tourists is obviously
effecting the heritage sites and the museums of the city and still solutions are needed in order to find a balance between heritage preservation and accessibility to the sites. The situation is effected also by recent changes in the Italian heritage management system which is leading to a considerable increasing of visitors in the major sites. The change is happening very quickly
and the need for solutions is urgent. In this contribution two case studies will be discussed as positive examples to manage the
effect of mass tourism in heritage sites. The two examples will be the entrances management policies applied in the Underwater
Archaeological Park of Gaiola in Naples, and the project AAA Accogliere Ad Arte Napoli which involves the main cultural institutions of the city to boost sustainable tourism policies.
