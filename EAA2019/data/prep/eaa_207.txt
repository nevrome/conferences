Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeological excavations and surveys at several sites in the coastal plain of northern Israel revealed evidence of sugar production dating from the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries. Three of the sites were subject to a multidisciplinary study
within the POMEDOR project, the other sites were examined within the framework of the Israel Antiquities Authority petrographic
research program. The results of the research show a typo-chronological and provenance development of the sugar moulds and
the molasses jars, that may be used for further dating the pottery assemblages. Under Fatimid and Crusader rule the pottery
workshops, manufacturing the vessels for sugar production, were located in the coastal area. During the Mamluk and Ottoman
period they moved further inland. The changes in both forms and fabrics, with corresponding changes in clay sources, are consistent with the transfer of the seat of government from â€˜Akko to Safed and are clear archaeological indications of the active
involvement of the central government in the production of sugar.
