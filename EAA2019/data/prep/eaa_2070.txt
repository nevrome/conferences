HISTORY AND PREHISTORY OF SPACE: THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT
Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms
Organisers: Bouissac, Paul (University of Toronto) - Gheorghiu, Dragos (National University of Arts - Bucharest)
Format: Regular session
With our contemporary knowledge of space including not only high precision maps of both the planet Earth and the solar system,
and the ability of exactly locating any position and event through GPS, it is difficult to imagine the representation of space that
was available to prehistoric populations from hunter-gatherers to sedentary pastoralists and farmers.
An understanding of the ways in which these populations variously experienced their surrounding space and the expanse beyond
their horizon must take into consideration the cognitive (pre-scientific) limitations that necessarily constrained the perception
and interpretation of their environment (e.g., the human inability to visually evaluate correctly the relative distances between
objects beyond the threshold of the sense of perspective. The heuristic imagination and simulation of the life conditions resulting from such limited cognitive affordances could help understand, using a top-down approach, the functions and meaning
of some of the graphic representations these populations produced. Conversely, following a bottom-up approach, this session
will also investigate the possibility of inferring from the archaeological record the spatial knowledge that grounded their actions
