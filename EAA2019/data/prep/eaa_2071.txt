(such as explorations and/or migrations) and artefacts (such as possible geographical and celestial graphic representations) in
view of the limitations and opportunities of their life experience of space. Analogical models like experimental and experiential
archaeology could be used as additional inference instruments. Comparison with surviving traditional cultures can also help
understanding these problematics but cannot suffice to conclusively determine long-past states of affairs.
Therefore this session will address the methodological issues of how reliable can such inferences be in view of the archaeological evidence we have and how these results may converge with the hypothetical (heuristic) reconstruction of a pre-scientific
perception and interpretation of space, while being mindful of the danger of being trapped in a circular argument.
