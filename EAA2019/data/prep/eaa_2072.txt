INTRODUCTION TO SESSION #366
Author(s): Bouissac, Paul (University of Toronto)
Presentation Format: Oral
No data by itself can be correctly interpreted in the absence of Information about its context. Most often this information is of
a spatial nature. All too often, we tend to assume that the perception of space is a human universal and we extrapolate our own
modern experience of space to reconstruct the spatial context of the archaeological record we attempt to interpret. However,
the way space is perceived and conceived is for a large part culture-dependent and, consequently, can be considered to have a
history and a prehistory. For example, modern migrants rely on geo-political maps. Early migrants were bound to have a markedly
different spatial experience that was not mediated by such artefacts but had to rely on other cognitive affordances such as
memorizing beacons and narratives. Can we infer, imagine, or simulate the prehistoric representation of space, and, thus, better
understand the spatial context of the archaeological record in view of this tentative reconstructions?
