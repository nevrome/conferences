VISIONS OF THE WORLD AS INFERRED FROM MAPS

Presentation Format: Oral
Maps since their inception have used symbols to cognize aspects of the surrounding or perceived space. For the earliest periods, archaeologists are sometimes unsure if some documents are actually maps, demonstrating how spatial representation
depends on symbolic systems. Because of their symbolic nature, maps can reveal the perception of space as much geographic
information. Even contemporary satellite-based maps are often augmented by symbols (e.g. for roads, cities, etc.) and in the
choice of colors, definition, and represented region betray a vision of the people that are using them. Today there is the space at
the borders of maps, in historical times mythological creatures represented the unknown, and earlier still maps ended at precise
boundaries defining the territory.
It is well known that during prehistoric times, exotica and long-distance exchanges challenged the spatial understanding of the
surrounding world, since the territories usually mapped failed much shorter of the actual range of interaction. Today we have the
opposite problem, with maps far exceeding our own spatial perception. Thus, maps often betray a certain vision of the world, be
it the space ‘owned’ by a culturally similar group, or the space understood or imagined by people (few will have been in space to
date, for example).
Archaeology in particular can provide a balanced view of the actual range of interactions and help understanding how exceptional
or indirect some interactions were. By combining information from maps and the material record of the same period and context,
I shall attempt to reconstruct the visions of the world that underpinned those selected cultures, between the real, imaginary
and the unknown.
