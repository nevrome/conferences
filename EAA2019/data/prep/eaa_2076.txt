Space is an abstract concept, difficult to represent and difficult to identify in the visual productions of prehistoric populations.
Despite these limitations, iconography sometimes allows the inference of spatial knowledge from graphic representations,
when one can identify a coherent network of meanings linking different images. One such example is the iconography of the
PPN architecture from Gobekli Tepe, in particular that of Enclosure D. The structural architectural elements were decorated
either with complex scenes featuring various species of animals, or only with solitary animals whose position and relationships
could offer information on the perception of the PPN environment. A toposemiotic decoding of the zoomorphic decoration of the
pillars can act as a cognitive instrument of interpretation of the spatial conception of the hunter-gatherers, where each animal
is ascribed to a specific ecosystem, correspondingly to a determined geographic and temporal space. In this interpretation the
enclosures of Gobekli-Tepe can be perceived as geographical and temporal spaces representing different moments of the year.
