Presentation Format: Oral
The methodology that is applied in general in the study of prehistoric spaces aims mainly at our estimation of the interaction
among people, social actions and the landscape, evaluating at first the existing archaeological record through the available literature but principally through the systematic excavations and the systematic surveys, in a thorough pursuit of the entirety of
the traces of the human activities. We are, therefore, able to connect the results and ideas of various disciplines dealing with
neolithic cultural landscapes, modes of production and socioecological systems, as well as to expand our current knowledge and
understanding of space applicable to Neolithic communities of Northern Greece (Macedonia, Thrace, Epirus and Thessaly) in a
diachronic perspective. A review of the current research on this area results in a thorough reappraisal and a creative reinterpretation of the life experience of space in the light of the complex entanglement of people and things towards more regional and
local perspectives, in order to gain a deeper understanding and to facilitate multifaceted insights into areas that for a very long
time were only peripheral to archaeological research, but despite their marginal location were central to prehistoric everyday life.
In order to negotiate and in an attempt to incorporate all these mixed data, we have to deconstruct the available archaeological
material through a procedure of intense critique and recompose it on the basis of meaningful units of the social activities taking place in the landscape, so that we finally derive the meaning from each element separately, appreciate the archaeological
information in reference with what it actually represented and classify the sites according to the represented human activities.
