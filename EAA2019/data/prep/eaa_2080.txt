Author(s): Dods, Roberta Robin (University of British Columbia)
Presentation Format: Oral
Edward Hall began his anthropological work in the southwest of the USA in the 1930s. He came to see contrasting concepts and
manifestations of the use of space through his interactions with both the Navaho and the Pueblo peoples. With the U.S. Army in
World War II in the Philippines and Europe and from his earlier diverse observations Hall “began to believe that basic differences in
the way that members of different cultures perceived reality were responsible for miscommunications of the most fundamental
kind” (Brown 2006). Subsequently Hall became the Director of the Foreign Service Institute in Arlington, Virginia. To this position
he brought his cultural perceptions of space and its cultural definitions as important to how we live as individuals and as members of a society and came to train the American diplomatic core in what has been considered its most productive post-war period. He worked his cross-cultural anthropological learnings on human use of space into the macro-analysis of cultural landscapes
and the micro-analysis of the dynamics of everyday interpersonal life. His book The Hidden Dimension (1966) effectively defined
for us public, social (consultative), and intimate (our ‘bubble’) spaces and the material objects there included that defined interactions. He recognized that place/space is the actualization of human thought transformed into cultural landscapes. Therefore,
the shape and form of place/space in a specific syntax announces a whole cultural territory of meaning. Ancient territory in which
we have not been privileged to participate can be seen as a visual language. They leave us their storyboard of life and with the
help of Hall we can come to understand their story.
