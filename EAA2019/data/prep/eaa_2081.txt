A POST-HISTORICAL QUERY ON DWELLING —THE HUMAN LIFE-FORM BETWEEN DARKNESS AND
LIGHT

If we take interest in the production and reception of space—as real and imagined expanse—it would seem that what we broadly
understand as maps would be located at their interstice: i.e. in between the production and reception of space. According to
the Talmud, human vision of the heavens was blocked by a sheath of light in day-time, which was removed at night as heavens
opened. In modernity, the satellite-view of the earth a recent tendency has been a darkening of the earth, as the result of human
populations crowding to big cities. These Metropoli have in turn become permanently sheathed by city-lights. While the heavens
have become crowded with satellites linked to the production of digital space, the reception of the nocturnal space has become
increasingly obstructed by city lights. In a historical stretch of time, the productive and receptive aspects of space has arguably
completed a full round (i.e. a revolution). The forms of dwelling (Heidegger) at the two ends of this time stretch: humanity caved
by darkness, and a different humanity caved by light. A task-force made up of a scenographer, a philosopher, a lawyer, a biologist
and MA-student has been working with these questions, flanked by an anthropologist. The paper discusses their process and
findings: our archaeological query here delves into what Massumi (2015) has called ‘bare activity’—the human life-form understood in terms of its mode-of-dwelling (cf, Agamben’s manéries); as a premise for building and thought, as aspects of production
and reception—i.e., a s symbolic compound primed by graphic re-presentations.
