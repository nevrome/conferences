ancestors or spirits lived and interacted with humans during the last millennia. Although the possibilities of archaeology are still
limited to discover this invisible power or agency, recent discoveries of material remains already allow a more differentiated idea
of ritual activities and the symbolic role of mountains. Therefore, this session aims to explore the nature of sacred or ritual topographies in mountainous and upland landscapes to develop a bigger and more coherent picture of different rituals, their archaeological indicators and the common characteristics of high-altitude “sacred” places. For this, it also seems essential to integrate
these transitional topographies into other forms of daily life and economy (e.g. settlements, pastures, hunting grounds, exploitation of different raw materials, mobility and trade routes), and to critically explore how the perception of sacred landscapes was
entangled with ancient communities. We would like to invite colleagues from all fields of archaeology, history, ethnology, biology,
anthropology and other relevant fields to discuss various manifestations and methodological reflections on ritual activities in
high altitude locations in a European or even global perspective, from hunter-gatherer societies through pastoral landscapes to
the sacralization of mountains during the Modern Age.
