DEATH OF THE ICEMAN: REFLECTIONS ON SACRED LANDSCAPE AND RITUAL PRACTICE IN THE
NEOLITHIC ALPS
Author(s): Reinhard, Johan (Retired)
Presentation Format: Oral
In recent years landscape archaeology has become an important theoretical approach to apply in studying archaeological sites
throughout the world. However, the sacred role that landscape could have played has been difficult to evaluate in ancient societies lacking historic documentation. This is still more the case the further back one goes in time. The Neolithic is especially
problematic due to the lesser certainty as to what constituted sacred objects and the beliefs that would have been associated
with them. In this paper, I will examine the role that the Alpine landscape could have played in our understanding one of the most
famous discoveries from the late Neolithic: the 5,300-year-old Iceman found in the Tyrolean Alps. Widely interpreted as his having been killed by chance on a high pass, several elements relating to the location he was found, the circumstances of his death,
the kinds and distribution of the artifacts recovered with him, and the condition of his body still remain difficult to explain. An
explanation utilizing an approach including sacred landscape and the ritual treatment of the Icemanâ€™s body is presented here that
appears more consistent with the known facts and suggests avenues of research that will assist in furthering our understanding
of Neolithic religion in the Alps.
