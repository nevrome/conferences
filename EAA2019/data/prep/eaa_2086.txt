Presentation Format: Oral
Two recently discovered sacrificial sites on lakeshores in Eastern Tyrol lead to a closer examination of this special type of feature above timberline. The “Brandopferplatz” at the Alkuser See at 2.440 m above sea level is located on a flat hilltop at the
south shore of the lake. Ceramic fragments in the charcoal strata date to the late Bronze Age, early Iron Age and Roman Period.
Calcinated bones suggest bloody sacrifices. A range of fibulas and shoe nails indicate an attendance during the late Iron Age
