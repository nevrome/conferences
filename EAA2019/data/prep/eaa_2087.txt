and Roman Imperial Period. Stray finds from the Anraser See on 2.540 m, mainly consisting of bowl and jug fragments of the
Laugen-Melaun type, can be compared with the ceramic ensemble of the Alkuser See.
Mountain lakes are not only prominent topographic features, but also numinous sites. Despite their remoteness they are closely
linked to high Alpine economic spaces. Both sites lie on the upper limits of recent mountain-pastures. In the area below the Alkuser See as well as at comparable topographic situations in the region there is also evidence for ranching in the later Iron Age. The
Alkuser See is embedded in an archaeological rich landscape, allowing linkage from the Brandopferplatz to other sites nearby.
With charcoal layers as traces of bonfires, the sacrificial sites join fire of burnt offerings with the water from the mountain lakes
in a “sacred” topography. Through giving an overview of known sacrificial sites on Alpine lakes, this work aims to induce a discussion about the connection between the ritual of burning offerings, the water of the lake, the location between summits and
various economic activities throughout prehistory.
