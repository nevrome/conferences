Within the last 170 years, a large number and variety of high-altitude finds and features have been discovered in the Alps that
can be linked to Bronze Age landscapes. In most cases a lack of a significant archaeological context for intentional deposits of
sacrificial or votive offerings of archaeological artefacts, make them methodologically hard to reconstruct and characterise in
detail. A few exceptional features nevertheless leave no doubt that they can be seen in such a sacrificial context. Within the
Alpine area, the Middle Bronze Age capture of a mineral spring at St. Moritz in the Upper Engadin Valley (Canton Graub체nden, Switzerland) may well be the most extraordinary and best-known example of such a site. Its large and multi-part construction was
built of larch wood during the summer of 1410 BC and due to waterlogged conditions is exceptionally well preserved. The centre
of the structure is formed by two enormous hollowed-out tree trunks, used to capture the highly carbonated spring water, which
were associated with several high prestige, partly non-local votive gifts. Originally unearthed during construction work in 1907,
this Bronze Age spring capture site at St. Moritz has been re-examined for the first time in terms of a detailed functionality reconstruction, dendrochronology, wood-working and sacred contextualisation. Only recently, the oldest sacred object known so far
from the Engadine Valley, an Early Bronze Age axe of Langquaid II type, was discovered in the River Inn at Ftan. Like St. Moritz, the
Lower Engadine Valley is known for its highly mineral-rich springs. This contribution aims to embed these newly examined sites
within the context of topography, mobility and sacrificial practices within the Alps and beyond.
