PYRENEES

Presentation Format: Oral
Mount Perdido (3355 m) is part of the Pyrenean massif of the Three Sisters and it is considered to be one of the highest limestone mountains in Europe. It overlooks the Ordesa valley, a nineteenth century destination for British hunters of wild mountain
goats. The area is visited nowadays by hikers and mountaineers, in search for the aesthetic experience of walking and climbing in
one of the most beautiful corners of the Pyrenees. The sacred and symbolic dimensions of mount Perdido are timidly revealed in
the Tibetan prayer flags and personal items deposited on its summit. The fascination exerted by this numinous peak is balanced
against its terrifying nature, as described in the Pyrenean folklore and in oral narratives that keep alive the memory of lethal
accidents on the dangerous slopes below the summit. Symbols of the Catholic religion, which crown the heights of neighboring
peaks, are not present on mount Perdido. The presence or absence of certain religious items at the foot, on the slopes and on the
summits of culturally modified peaks can be analyzed from an archaeological perspective, as material evidences which reveal
the sacred dimension of mountainous landscapes.
