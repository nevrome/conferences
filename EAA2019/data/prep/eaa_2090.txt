In the vicinity of the Wroczeń mountain, in the last decades, many prehistoric settlements have been discovered. Most of them
date to the Roman period. However, the settlements associated with the La Tène period and the early Iron Age are known as
well. Some of these sites, located at the foot of the Wroczeń mountain, were excavated and provided numerous archaeological
materials. The area of the Wroczeń itself until 2015, was not penetrated to a significant extent by archaeologists, due to the
forest cover of the mountain.
Over the last four years, due to accidental discoveries and conducted archaeological excavations, the image of this place has
changed significantly. Discoveries of deposits of iron tools as well as other objects, like bracelets, give evidence to the sacred
significance of this place in the La Tène period. There are also finds, from the Wroczeń as well as from the other mountains in
the Sanok region, that would suggest a special role of the mountains also for the bronze age societies. Between 2015 and 2018
excavations, which led to the exploration of the whole site, have been conducted on the necropolis of the Przeworsk culture,
