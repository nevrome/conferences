dated to the Roman period. During the research on this small burial ground located on the slopes of Wroczeń, ten graves were
discovered of which half were, richly furnished with weaponry, burials of warriors.
The discoveries of recent years allow a new interpretation of the Wroczeń mountain as a place that occupied a prominent place
within the sacrum of the iron age community. The presentation aims to present the results of field-work carried out in recent
years on the mountain and the possibilities of interpreting the Wroczeń mountain as a place of religious significance in the context of other finds from the Sanok region.
