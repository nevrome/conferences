Early medieval tribal beliefs mainly focused around deities and phenomena related to nature. Among them, we find sacred mountains, springs, stones, groves, trees. Located on the Sudeten Foreland, Mount Ślęża – Silensi, since the prehistoric times was
surrounded by worship. On cloudy days its peak is shrouded in fog, during the storms most atmospheric discharges are concentrated around the top of this mountain. These phenomena perhaps have already been noticed in the Lusatian culture, and then
in the Latene period and Early Middle Ages. Pagan religious practices in Ślęża we can find in historical sources as well as archaeological finds. In addition to the cultivated practices on Ślęża that have also survived in folk tales, we know a dozen or so points
in the Sudetenland, which are considered to be medieval places of worship (stones, springs). Among the practices of symbolic
significance, one can also mention finds of foundation offerings or, most probably, deposits of ferrous objects. All these sources
create an image of the relationship between human spirituality and the surrounding mountains. The research was carried out as
part of the project of the National Program for the Development of Humanities (No. 2aH 15 0283 83).
