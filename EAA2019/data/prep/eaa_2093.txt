Presentation Format: Oral
In the coastal heaths of Agder, there are a number of sacrificial sites in conjunction with topographically defined marshlands. The
finds and sites are scattered across a belt in the heaths 7-10 km inland from the Agder coast, and situated at a height of 160180 meters above sea level. The locations are neither coastal, typical inland nor high mountain locations. Comparing the data
gathered from finds, the sacrificial objects so far found appear to have a chronological center in the Neolithic and Bronze Age,
between 3800 and 500 BC.
The sacrificial marshes are topographically quite similar, and often in the form of concave recesses in the landscape. The recesses are shielded from the outside by elevations in the landscape, usually in all directions. Centrally located on the sacrificial sites
are marshes, or small bodies of water enclosed by marshes. The places are perceived as closed, hidden and shielded from the
outside world. Common to the majority of the locations are single deposited objects on the edge of the marsh. In some locations,
there are also grave mounds at a higher elevation overlooking the marsh; these are so far without the discovery of sacrificial
objects.
The objects found are usually not a result of archaeological investigations, but found due to landowners work with the cultivation of the areas or drainage of marshland. Much of the data gathered does thus come from randomly submitted findings. It
was not until 2018 that the Vest-Agder county council had the opportunity to investigate one of these sacrificial sites. In this
presentation, we will focus on the results from the archaeological investigations of Gullmyra (“Gold marsh”) at Hageland in the
municipality of Mandal.
