LANDSCAPES?

Presentation Format: Oral
In the Southern Sami areas of Scandinavia, decorated frame drums (gievrie) were used for different ritual and quotidian practices
through millenia.
They were however viewed as pagan objects by many Christians and were confiscated by the church during different phases of
periodic missionary zeal. Many of the drumsâ€™ owners, prefered to hide them on seculded mounatin sites rather than handing them
in to the authorities.
A number of Southern Sami frame drums have been recovered from remote mountain sites in recent years and have subsequently been conserved and taken into museum collections. But is this knee-jerk policy appropriate or indeed the best way to
safeguard these unique objects and sites?
In this presentation, we will explore and discuss different perspectives on the current, policy of collecting remains of Southern
Sami Gjervie from their mountain hiding places and placing them in museum collections. Are we not denuding these ritual mountain sites thorugh our current rescue practices?
