As a result of the Etruscan expansion that from the mid-6th century B.C. also involved the westernmost area of the Po Valley, the
Etruscans, favoured by the use of writing, held economic and political control over a culturally heterogeneous territory, characterized by Ligurian and Celtic presences. Before the Celtic invasion at the beginning of the IV century B.C., the ancient sources
mention the presence of Ligurian people in the high areas of the Apennines and Celtic people in the high plains and hills.
It is precisely from the Apennine hills that traces of different cult places come.
What kinds of rituals are displayed on these hilltop sites? Which is the connection between these sacred places and the important communication routes and trade roads that cross the Po Valley during the Iron Age? What changes follow the Celtic
invasion?
The aim of this paper is to analyse the ritual behaviours on the hilltop sites and their connection with the political, economic and
religious dynamics of the Po Valley during the Iron Age, considering the cultual porosity that characterises this border territory.
