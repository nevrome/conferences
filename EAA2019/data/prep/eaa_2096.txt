Sacred places played different roles which can be understood only through a global diachronic landscape approach; pre-roman
and Roman sanctuaries may still function during late antiquity and early middle ages, they can change place while maintaining
their function or they can disappear leaving their sacred perception unchanged. The spatial and chronological framework must
be related to the features of the ancient communities that inhabited those landscapes. The use of sacred places such as high
grounds, springs, woods, and peaks is marked by the continuity or re-use of sacred places despite a sometimes unfavorable
settlement substrate. What are the agencies of sacred topographies during a specific chronological phase? What are the features that affect the continuity/discontinuity of those places? What are their relationships with human and natural geographies?
Finally, How all these components work with each other in the construction of historical landscapes?
This paper aims at answering these questions by analyzing the sacred topography from pre-roman to early medieval times in the
Peligna Valley (Abruzzo, Central Italy), a mountain and high ground landscape characterized by river valleys and steep reliefs and
inhabited from the Bronze Age to nowadays.
