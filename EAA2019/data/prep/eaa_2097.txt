MONTES IN LATIN LITERARY EVIDENCES
Author(s): Curca, Roxana-Gabriela (Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi)
Presentation Format: Oral
The mountains (montes) have been the subject of important contributions in the exegesis and provided a comprehensive overview on this particular aspect. This subject it is far too large to be treated in its completeness, therefore a selection of most
representatives texts will be emphasised and discussed. The exegesis in this area corroborated the literary sources with the
archaeological realities and the philological analysis. This contribution aims to explore the different types of perception of the
authors regarding the mountains as reflected in Latin sources. Our research, based on the works of historians, geographers or
poets, aims to provide a classification of these perceptions. The mountains are described either only from geographical point of
view, either underlying their symbolic features. The Latin literary records will draw attention to different aspects, such as military
and strategic role, sacred ceremonies performed on the mountain, impact of the mountain into human behaviour, the mountain
wilderness, etc.
