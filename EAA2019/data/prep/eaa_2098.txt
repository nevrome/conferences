THE MOUNTAINS OF CRETE: RITUAL AND REPRESENTATION OF SPIRITUAL GEOGRAPHY IN THE
MINOAN BRONZE AGE

Presentation Format: Oral
The mountains of Crete are the geographical background to the cultures of Crete in all periods. They are present not just in physical form, but also in ritual and representational form. For Bronze Age Minoan Crete, the mountains are spiritually manifested as
the peak sanctuaries, which are the dominant cult places of Minoan civilisation. There are around 30 of these mountain peaks,
who share features of topography and material finds deposited through rituals of offering, primarily clay figurines (animals, humans, and votive limbs). In this presentation we propose to draw together the threads of the material culture of the peak sanctuaries, and to demonstrate how they impact into the religious life of Minoan culture. We show how sacred geography expresses
concepts of ancestry (linking the living and the dead), community fellowship (sharing processes of creating and offering votives), leadership (representation of mountains in elite art and symbolism), and the journeys of spiritual experience.
