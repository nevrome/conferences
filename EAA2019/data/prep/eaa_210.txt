Presentation Format: Oral
The expansion of the production economy in the Iberian Peninsula is currently one of the main research topics in the archaeological investigation of SW Europe. However, essential aspects concerning the subsistence of the Neolithic groups in the region, as
the relative importance of livestock management in the farming way of life remain poorly understood.
Multiscalar interdisciplinary investigations that integrate geoarchaeological study of sediments from early pastoral sites located in caves and rock-shelters can improve our comprehension of how the new human-animal relationships introduced from
the Neolithic in Iberia impacted the environment, the exploitation of natural resources and the territorial organization of early
farming communities.
In this communication the methodological approaches used for the study of these archaeological contexts are synthesized to
determine the key research questions that require futher investigation and how the integration of archaeological, experimental
and ethnoarchaeological field and high-resolution multiproxies and their correlation at local and regional scale can help us to
address those issues.
