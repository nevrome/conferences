GEOMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTS WITH MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL TIBET: ROYAL TOMBS OF THE
CHONGYE VALLEY
Author(s): Romain, William (Independent reseacher)
Presentation Format: Oral
Situated in central Tibet, the Royal Tombs of Chongye Valley are the final resting place for many of the imperial emperors of the
Tibetan Empire to include Songtsen Gampo (AD 605–AD 649), the first emperor of Tibet. Among the Royal Tombs of the Chongye
valley is a group of ten known as the Mura group. Emperor Gampo’s burial mound is found in this group. Analysis of Google Earth
imagery shows that Emperor Gampo’s burial mound (130 m x 124 m x 18 m), as well as eight others belonging to the royal lineage
located in the Mura group are geomantically aligned to special mountains. The targeted mountains are associated with important
deities and legends. Among the special mountains are Mount Gonpo - the locale for the Monkey God and Rock Ogress creation
myth that accounts for the origin of the Tibetan people; and Mount Shelbrag, where the first legendary king of Tibet descended
from Heaven. Also targeted was Mount Shampo - the manifestation of a mountain deity said to be a protector of the royal lineage.
It is proposed that the geomantic connections to these and other legendary mountain places affirmed the divine lineage of the
emperors and provided spiritual protection for the deceased.
