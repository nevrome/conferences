connecting route of the old royal cities Kathmandu and Bhaktapur.
The ensemble, founded between the 5th to the 7th century CE, is one of the earliest cult sites of Lord Śiva in Nepal. In this 3200
sqm large area 17 buildings of different periods and functions are assembled. The Anantaliṅgeśvara Mahādeva Temple is an
integral part of a sacral landscape, consisting of 64 śivaliṅga, which encircle the nepali national shrine, the Paśupatināt Temple
in Deopatan, in three concentric rings.
Genesis, continuity and changes of the temple complex through time are the research questions of the project. In this case we
want to point out an exceptional special feature of the Hindu iconography and architecture - the concept of the sacred landscape
and there relationship between cult, culture and the peoples living in this high mountain area.
