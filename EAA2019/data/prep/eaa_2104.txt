GRAVE GOODS AND IDENTITY IN THE NILGIRI HILLS

Presentation Format: Oral
The Nilgiri Hills, a massif of 2500 km2 that form part of the Western Ghats mountain range, are located at the intersection of the
modern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala in South India. It is a region of montane tropical forests with peaks over 2500
m, and is the homeland of 15 plus indigenous groups, the ‘hill tribes’ of colonial ethnography.
The hilltops of the Nilgiris are dotted with ancient graves, which are marked by stone circles and earthen mounds. Excavations at
burial sites were started by British officers in the 1840s. Elaborated pottery urns containing incinerated bones were unearthed
along with other grave goods, such as gold ornaments, bronze bowls, and iron weapons. By convention —albeit inaccurate—
these assemblages are described as ‘prehistoric’ and dated to the ‘South Indian Iron Age’ (c. 1200-300 BCE).
Forest-dwellers are mentioned often in texts and inscriptions, and represented in the figurative arts produced by the dynastic
powers of the Indian plains. Since these people seem to have created neither written records nor monumental art, the knowledge
of their history is limited and biased.
Archaeological research in Indian forests remains at an early and undeveloped stage. This is partly due to practical difficulties in
carrying out research in such areas, but the paucity of research is also a by-product of the colonial misperception of forest-dwelling communities as primitive and isolated.
This paper will look at how forest-dwellers created and negotiated their identities and belief systems in relation to their environment by presenting the preliminary results of a recent survey of the area around Udhagamandalam in the Nilgiri Hills, and of the
study of Nilgiri burial practices and grave goods.
