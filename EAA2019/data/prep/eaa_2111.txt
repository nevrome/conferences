RHYTHMS IN MATERIAL CULTURE
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes
Organisers: Paladino, Vincent (American Anthropological Association) - Gheorghiu, Dragos (National University of Arts in Bucharest)
Format: Regular session
This session shall examine the relationship between material culture and rhythms, from visual art to music in an attempt to
define and express common components. Rhythm in painting is expressed as pattern distribution. In sculpture, rhythm is locked
temporally, fusing the expression of a moment with timelessness, bringing forth a new expression from movement and being.
Musical instruments convey the rhythmic movement of the breath or the hands through their shape, illustrating that existence
as we know it is meaningless without rhythmic cycles which power life and beingness. The rhythms of place, of architecture and
urban planning, shall be considered here; objects divided by space are experienced as related through rhythm, and temporality as
a sense is quantified as movement, beats and rests. The manner and methods through which rhythm is integrated with objects
of creation is here explored. We invite archaeologists, anthropologists and artists to contribute to this debate.
