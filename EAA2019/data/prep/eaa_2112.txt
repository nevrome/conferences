INTRODUCTION TO SESSION #369: RHYTHM IN MATERIAL CULTURE
Author(s): Paladino, Vincent (Rutgers University; American Anthropological Association)
Presentation Format: Oral
Material culture arises from the deep rhythms of cyclic nature, manifesting through the bodies of plants and animals. Human
bodies generate objects that are crafted by human movement, whether voluntary or autonomic. The rhythmic pulses of our lives
are driven by the periodic undulations of our entire solar system. Rhythm in and from our bodies is a manifestation of a crucially
important aspect of our reality: polarities give rise to rhythms. Exchanging positions through attracting and repulsing we manifest it in ourselves, with limbs that extend through the pulling of their bones. All the goods crafted by hand bear the marks of
their maker’s motions. The body’s planes are crossed by limbs and digits, leaving material altered to the shape of their movement,
in angles and waves. This session addresses the expression of rhythms in the objects and structured spaces crafted by human
hands and minds: Rhythm in Material Culture.e4
