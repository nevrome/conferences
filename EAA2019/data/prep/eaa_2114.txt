A tell settlement could be described as follow: a rhythmic mode of dwelling on a limited surface, surrounded by a palisade and
ditch, characterized by cyclical processes of construction and deconstruction.
Viewed from the perspective of symbolic behaviour, the tell-settlement appears as the result of a complex functional and symbolic activity, and of alternating stages of dwelling and abandonment.
An examination of the tellsâ€™ stratigraphy represents not only the analysis of the rhythms of dwelling and abandonment, but of the
rhythms of culture and wilderness of a place, revealed to us as overlapped layers of house debris, separated by layers of soil, or
of sediments from disastrous floods.
A special case in the rhythmicity of the dwelling in a tell is the recycling of old material as a symbolic technology of rejuvenation
of the old substance of the settlement.
The paper will present the rhythms of living and abandonment in two tell-settlements from the Lower Danube area.
