TRACING GRAVITY - CREATING SPACE THROUGH ENCOUNTERS WITH SANDSTONE BOULDERS AND
STONE AGE ENGRAVINGS IN FONTAINEBLEAU
Author(s): Samuelsen, Geir (University of Bergen)
Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation will reflect upon one specific encounter with Mesolithic engravings in the region of Fontainebleau, France,
from the viewpoint of rhythm in works of art and rhythm in bodily movement. The encounter took place after several years of
traveling and climbing in the same area and involves an artistic view on archaeology and contemporary archaeological research.
The presentation will reflect upon skill and involvement in climbing, rhythmical gestures in the execution of painting, rhythms and
visual vibrations in the final work of art, time and synchronicity. The presentation will focus on the mystery and beauty of the area
and on this specific meeting, and the artistic pretext of the encounter. It will also sketch out some possible artistic strategies in
the continuation of the research into these specific engravings, and into archaeological research in general from the viewpoint
of art. The presentation will discuss art and archaeology in an expanded field. It will contain pictures.
Geir Harald Samuelsen is an artist; painter and photographer, and Associate Professor, Artistic Research Leader at The Art Academy, Department of Contemporary Art, University of Bergen, Norway.
