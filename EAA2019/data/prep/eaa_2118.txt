Presentation Format: Oral
In the work of stage-director—and dramaturge—Tore Vagn Lid, the rhythmic structure of his work is literal. It is literal at different
levels of superposed practices. At one level, the structure of his plays is rooted in the rhythm, often inspired by reggae. At another level, the stage repertoire is regularly developed from musical studies, or études. These studies are of three different kinds:
micro-études, macro-études and reflective études. As a stage-director Vagn Lid rarely sticks to the text-materials he develops
as a dramaturge. Rather he develops score that allow non-same locations to join onstage: each of his plays thereby constitute
a single, but complex site. The broader interest of his work lies in how the music—conceived as an «object»— constitutes a
method to explore the relationship between superimposed locations (online, onstage and video) in a sense of story that does
not follow a linear plot. His approach is post-historical in the sense that the actants in his plays often are located in different
places and times, yet are conjoined in a single site as contemporaries (Agamben)). He intervenes directly into time and politics
as the ‘force to own time’ (Massumi). All his plays are political, in a literal sense: a) in terms of his choice of themes and topics; b)
in the sense that the politics takes place spatially onstage (most of them spaces built to include the public into the play). Most
of his plays are such that the the audience can easily deconstruct the information into its constituent parts, featuring in his 1)
research-materials, and 2) the formal constraints he works with, in counterpoint. The communication within the play—between
its actants—beyond the play, as conveyed by the audience, is preempted, but is also fundamentally unpredictable.
