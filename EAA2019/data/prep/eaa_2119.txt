Each historical period has its own style in architecture, music and art. These laws also apply to small architectural forms, in our
case to tiled stoves.
The Nikon period (the time when the construction was run by Patriarch Nikon himself – 1654-1666) is characterized by the most
complex compositions of carpet tiles, where the full pattern consists of 17-18 separate figures arranged in a certain order and
distributed in 2-3 rows. Each turn of the pattern ends with a new flower or flowerpot at the same time similar to the previous and
completely different of it.
Peter’s time (the reign of Peter I) is characterized by the individualization of a single tile. At the same time, the creation of these
separate plot pictures of the whole structure required the inclusion of additional elements that do not carry any constructive
task, in addition to connecting diverse subjects into a single whole, the creation of a common rhythm of the composition. In some
cases, the difference in the color solution of the same tiles played a unifying rhythmic function.
As we can see, different principles of rhythmic integration of individual parts into the whole stove corresponded to different
historical epochs.
