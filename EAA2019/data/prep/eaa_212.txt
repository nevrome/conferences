Presentation Format: Oral
Since the early management of animals during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B of Southwest Asia, animal dung has been used as a
valuable resource. Recently, a growing body of archaeological sites from various areas and periods has presented evidence for
the use of dung, especially for fuel, and manure. The ethnographic record highlights the common use of dung also as an important construction material. However, the use of dung for this purpose is so far less evident in the archaeological record due to
either research bias, poor preservation of dung markers, or relative rarity of its use. In order to identify the exact cause for the
lower representation of dung use for construction in archaeological sites and its cultural implications, we need: 1) To further develop the multi-proxy methodology for dung identification at the micro-scale of constructed features (using micromorphology,
phytolith and dung spherulites analysis, and chemical analysis such as FTIR, ICP-AES and GC-MS spectrometry), 2) To map the
spatial distribution of the different dung micro remains in the site in order to identify “hot spots” of dung use; and 3) To correlate
