TEMPOS OF TIME: THE RHYTHMS OF CHANGE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF ‘REALITY’
Author(s): Dods, Roberta Robin (University of British Columbia)
Presentation Format: Oral
Edward Hall’s naming of time (a taxonomy, a typology, a classification, a categorization….?), as experienced by humans, becomes
a starting point of a short history on some archaeologically cogent concepts of change through time. The concept of change
through time (evolution) can be seen in biological and cultural analyses of the 19th Century. We recall this in the ordering of tool
technology with Thomsen’s Three Age System and subsequently with Morgan’s Unilinear Theory of Cultural Evolution, which in
some sense ‘fits’ with the earlier ‘Age’ system. It was, however, Petrie in the late 19th century that turned us to the beginning of
a micro-analysis with his seriation of the ceramics in an Egyptian cemetery. In a sense this was almost a poetic, surreal contemplation of the material world although it took additional subsequent data to give us its true usefulness. Indeed, seriation allowed
the jump to the archaeological application of the Doppler effect – our adventure in a significant area of physics that speaks to a
deeper contemplation of time/space in a material world. This then is our entrée into new and expanding understandings of time
via quantum mechanics. Emerging paradigms of how time ‘operates’ challenge us to consider what would have been seen as
fantastical in the past. From this we can vision our lives through time as a tangle/untangle of cosmic poetic metre.
