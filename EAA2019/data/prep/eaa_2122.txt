RHYTHMS IN MATERIAL CULTURE: THE CASE OF THE PARTHENON
Author(s): Pateraki, Kleanthi (Independent Researcher)
Presentation Format: Oral
The aim of the oral presentation is to examine the Parthenon as a typical example of a building, in which the existence of an inner
rhythm is ascertained, that is harmony, balance and charm.
Attention will be focused on the architecture of the temple. The intentions of the architects will be highlighted, as well as the
elements which indicate the harmony and overall architectural integrity of the monument. Moreover, the mathematical (e.g. the
entasis of the columns) and the architectural optical deceptions (i.e. the unique optical refinements of the Doric order) will be
presented, through which the inequalities and deviations were set off and the technical problems were solved. Furthermore, the
innovations found in the building will be mentioned, which enrich its impression. In addition, particular importance will be given to
calculated proportionings of parts and rhythmic correspondences (for instance at the areas of the entablature), which, according to some studies, match the so-called “golden ratio”.
The result of all the above is unprecedented technical perfection. The Parthenon becomes a “living” temple, a vibrant organic
ensemble, a balanced and harmonious whole characterized by amazing unity of form, monumental majesty and unique grace.
