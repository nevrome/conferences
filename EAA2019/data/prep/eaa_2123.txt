POLYNESIAN CREATION MYTHS AS RHYTHMIC LITURGIES OF THE LIVING UNIVERSE

Presentation Format: Oral
Increasingly western scientific disciplines and indigenous ways of knowing, or Indigenous Science, are brought together. Indigenous Science refers to the place based, holistic and spiritual knowledge system and wisdom traditions of indigenous peoples
(Colorado 2014; Colorado & Hurd 2018). Here, Indigenous Science perspectives are presented in a reciprocal relationship of contextualization with applied archaeology, visual arts, and sound performance. Contemporary Polynesian myths and images, based
on lores of the Maori People of Aotearoa, New Zealand, are explored as we consider the emergent creation spiral, the realms of Te
Poâ€”the nights of creation and birth of consciousness, vibration and mystery (Henare 2001, Jones 2013). The rhythms encoded
in creation stories have been handed down as a sequence of transmissions that instruct many aspects of material culture in Indigenous life. For Maori, this is found in whakairo (carvings) of the whare-tupuna, the ancestral carved house, and waka, sea-faring canoes. Also, in raranga (weaving), we find patterns on whariki, ceremonial mats, the ket, baskets to hold knowledge, and the
korowai, cloaks worn to express, preserve and keep warm. Besides their functional influence on material culture and life ways,
we honor these indigenous accounts of creation as rhythmic liturgies of the living, breathing universe, illuminating the intangible
architecture of all creation as well as our sacred and contemporary role within it.
