struct and analyse the great tangle of human cultural evolution and its dynamics, and the essence of what we are as societies.
The EAA Bern motto, Beyond Paradigms, reminds us that, if paradigms become barriers (like mountains), they can limit our vision,
enclose our lives and experiences and our ability to think creatively.
Thinking beyond the developed theoretical constraints of our discipline, will enable us to discover the fissures in these paradigms that, like the passes through the Swiss mountains, can be routes for communication, interaction, exchange and convergence. EAA BarcelonaÂ´s motto, Reflecting Futures, reminded us that Archaeology is as much about the future as it is about the
past because archaeologists superpower is to understand and articulate how the future comes into being. Archaeology has the
capacity to reflect on the societal and cultural forces that create our futures and therefore has some ability to think about how
these processes will shape the future.
The session will start with some short presentations by EAA members from different backgrounds, fields of activity and personal/professional circumstances. This will be followed by an open discussion drawing from the contributions and welcoming
essential reflection and opinion from the floor.
