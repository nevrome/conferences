EXPERIMENTAL COMPLEXITIES IN YAYOI POTTERY PRODUCTION: SOCIAL LEARNING AND
TECHNOLOGICAL CHOICE IN MICRO-REGIONAL TRANSITIONAL GROUPS

Situated between the 14,000 year long hunter-gatherer societies of the Jomon period and the fully-fledged wet-rice agricultural
society of the middle Yayoi period; the early Yayoi period in Kyushu Island, Japan saw several significant upheavals in societal
structures, subsistence practices, and the creation of multi-leveled material cultures attributed to large waves of migration
from the Korean peninsula into the Japanese archipelago. Looking at the clean-cut pottery typo-chronologies of contemporary
literature on this important transitional period may lead one to believe that the indigenous material culture, especially pottery,
was completely uprooted and replaced by the technologically superior migrant culture. The smooth transition of pottery shape
types also prompts images of standardized pottery production at the local and region-wide level. However, this project, through
the use of combined multivariate statistical pottery analysis and detailed idiosyncratic analysis shows that this initial period of
interaction between the indigenous Jomon and the incoming migrants was instead characterized by multiple intervals of experimentation in pottery production methods and vastly different social learning environments derived from divergences in technological choices. Within the small Northern-Kyushu micro-region, pottery producing groups show differing ranges of specialization of pottery production as well as the incorporation of potters of various skill levels. Thus, this author contends that previous
studies that understand this period of material culture change as cultural dominance by the incoming migrants have completely
ignored the complex nature of information transmission and the important role of technological choices and experimentation in
the pottery production process.
