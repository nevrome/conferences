the micro scale evidence for the use of dung to the macro-scale archaeological finds in order to have a better interpretation of
the origin of the dung remains. The study of dung exploitation in general, and particularly its use in construction will contribute
to our understanding of human-animal relations, subsistence practices, human technology, and human impact on the environment. It provides information on resource management according to human needs and environmental conditions (e.g. prioritizing
construction over fuel or vice versa), which adds an innovative view-point on human adaptation strategies. Here we present
preliminary results of the study of dung remains from Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the Southern Levant that form part of the
MapDung Project.
