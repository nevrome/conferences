The appearance of Neolithic traditions among Mesolithic hunter-gatherers can be connected with migration of Neolithic farmers.
Environmental factors were probably among the causes: the transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic (at c. 8200 calBP) was
characterized by complete aridisation in the steppe and forest-steppe zones. The earliest Neolithic sites with ‘Elshanian-type’
pottery are located between the steppe and forest steppe zones in the Middle Volga River basin. The closest analogues to the
typological and technological characteristics of Elshanian pottery were found on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea and the
Central Asian interfluves at the Uchaschy, Daryasay, and Dzhebel sites. Radiocarbon dates on the earliest Neolithic materials
in Central Asia have the same age. Because of the 8200 calBP climatic event the groups which produced the ‘Kairshak type’
pottery moved from the northern Caspian shore towards the steppe region of the Volga River basin and the northwestern coast
of the Caspian. They influenced the development of the Varfolomeevka and Dzhangar traditions in these regions. The characteristics of the pottery, the ornamentation techniques, and motifs support this. The process of neolithisation on the north coast
of the Caspian and the Lower Volga regions was embedded in the period c. 8500–7900 calBP. Naturally, in dry periods the forest
zone with woodlands and rich food resources was a favourable area for people from more arid southerly regions. The results of
thin-section analysis of Elshanian pottery and radiocarbon dating support this conception.
