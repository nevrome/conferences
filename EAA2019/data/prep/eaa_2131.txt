Identifying and understanding the starting points of early technologies is not always straightforward. This is the case for the
beginning of pottery production, as there are no accepted criteria for what the expression of a site’s first pottery should be.
The characteristics of the earliest known ceramic vessels can be associated with certain prerequisites necessary for the adoption of the new technology. The very same features can yet be a secondary and logical consequence of the start of the ceramic
production at specific locations. Similarly, the technological approaches taken by Early Neolithic potters can either be considered as evidence for strict adherence to conservative received pottery traditions; or as a marker of locally developed innovations, dispersed further along the Neolithisation trajectories.
The central question is therefore how to examine the possible experimental phase? This discussion explores the following:
should an experimental stage be expected at all? Is there an acceptable body of specific features that outline such period? What
are the hallmarks for a phase in which people tested, perhaps failed and improved further their technical skills and approaches?
How long would this last? Did previous knowledge influence the start of the new technology or did the pottery ‘arrived’ along with
fixed recipes?
Several Southeast European Early Neolithic sites will be considered as examples for the complexity and the importance of this
topic. This will lead towards a re-evaluation of otherwise well-known features of the Early Neolithic pottery production. The ex-
