a significant threshold in the transformation from primitive craft production to market and/or tributary economy. In the Ancient
Near East, this development, in turn, is linked to the emergence of complex hierarchical social structures and urbanism. However,
neither the socio-economic development of Varna nor even that of EBA Troy has been discussed in such terms. The parallel development of other technologies - pottery, stone-knapping, lapidary, and bone carving - documented at these and neighbouring
sites will be reviewed as a control group to assess the extent of craft specialization and division of labour, as well as its implications for reconstructing the socio-economic structure in these distinct societies.
