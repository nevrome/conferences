Macro- and microscopic observations and SEM imaging of metal objects dated to various stages of the Bronze Age show a picture far from ideal model of prehistoric metalworking. It is also completely different from what we used to think about Bronze
Age metallurgy shifting softly from beginner (early stages of early Bronze Age) over advanced (late stages of the early Bronze
Age) to master level in the late Bronze Age. Same simplified and probably untrue model is often supported by the expected tin
content increasing from the early Bronze Age onwards. Analysed metal objects represent however a variety of techniques and
recipes depending rather on the expected quality. They show discrepancy with the model assuming simple and linear growth of
tin content. Moreover, there is a abundant evidence – even at a single archaeological location – of unsuccessful casting events,
lack of control of the temperature and very likely random recipes of copper-based alloys. Interestingly, these are observed not
only in early Bronze Age material. Diachronic analysis of the both sampled and complete metal objects showed successes and
failures in copper-based metallurgy in the Bronze Age and at the transition of the Bronze and Iron Age as well.
