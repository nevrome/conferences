CLEAR SKIES OVER THE INDO-EUROPEAN HOMELAND?

“Any solution to the homeland problem must be able to explain how we can recover cognate terms associated with farming from
Ireland to India.” Thus James Mallory (2013) identifies one of the darkest clouds over the IE steppe homeland. In view of the
lack of “serious evidence for arable agriculture east of the Dnieper until after 2000 BCE”, the Steppe Hypothesis indeed fails
to explain the fact that the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European lexicon contains not many, but certainly some words related to
arable agriculture. Despite the Steppe Hypothesis being favored by most Indo-Europeanists on the basis of additional linguistic
and increasingly also palaeogenomic evidence, a mismatch therefore still exists with the archaeological record. To investigate
the extent of this mismatch, this paper tests the newest insights on the reconstructed Indo-European vocabulary associated
with crop domestication against an updated archaeological record on the agricultural remains from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe
before the 2nd millennium BCE.
