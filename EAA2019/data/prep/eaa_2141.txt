an (IE) languages than the treatment of wheeled vehicles, including a useful map showing the distribution of different common
terms across IE subgroups. These linguistic data have regularly been used as an argument that the common ancestor of all IE
languages must have been spoken at a time and place where wheeled vehicles already were in use. On the other hand, this reasoning has been criticized from more than one perspective, proposing alternative explanations for the data that do not presuppose the presence of such technology for the reconstructed protolanguage, and thus allowing for an earlier dating. The aim of my
contribution is to reassess these linguistic data and what they really can tell us and what they cannot. Three main points will have
to be discussed in this respect: 1. What exactly do we have to reconstruct for which protolanguage? Is the picture significantly
different for the ancestor of all IE languages (including the Anatolian subgroup that possibly split off before all others) compared
to the common ancestor of the rest, or the protolanguages of subfamilies? 2. How secure is the semantic reconstruction of
protolanguage items? E.g., how and when can we know that a word reconstructed from attested words meaning ‘wheel’ actually
meant ‘wheel’ in the protolanguage? 3. Under which circumstances is it possible to explain apparently identical words with the
same meaning by spread across language boundaries so that the term cannot be reconstructed for the protolanguage? These
questions are not trivial, and there is a danger of oversimplification, especially in interdisciplinary research. However, a refined
analysis can still lead to nuanced answers leading to progress.
