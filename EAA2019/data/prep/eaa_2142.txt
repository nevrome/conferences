Mikhailovka-Ovsyanka, which is a production settlement of metal workers, was excavated in the south of the Samara Trans-Volga region. The 14С data obtained suggest that this settlement was in operation throughout the 18th–15th centuries BC. Miners
used mines to search and extract copper ore. The occupation layer yielded a lot of ceramics, more than one hundred stone implements and around two hundred bone tools related to production and treatment of copper minerals as well as fragments of
ore, slag, crucibles, casting molds and tool fragments. Thousands of bones of domesticated animals are a peculiar trait of this
occupation layer. Practically all bones are kitchen refuse. The question is where the cattle were kept, and who grazed the cattle
consumed as food at the settlement? The stable isotope study and determination of the season when the animals were slaughtered and the age of the slaughtered animals provide an opportunity to discuss the organization of a specific annual/seasonal
production cycle that both the miners and the residents from the settlements located nearby and at a distance from Mikhailovka-Ovsyanka (manual workers and cattle breeders) were, probably, involved in. The study has been performed with support of the
RFFI Drevnosti grant 17-29- 04176 and under the State Assignment - project 33.1907.2017/PCH.
