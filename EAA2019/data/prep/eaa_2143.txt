THE HORSES OF BOTAI – HUNTED OR HERDED? A REAPPRAISAL OF THE EVIDENCE

There has been controversy as to whether horses were domesticated and ridden as early as the 4th millennium BCE.
Like the work of Lefebvre des Noëttes, whose proposition that ancient harness strangled the horses and prevented effective
equid traction until the “invention” of the horse-collar in the Middle Ages (a mistaken conclusion based on misinterpretation of
the evidence, but still widely disseminated today), David Anthony’s well-written and easily accessible theories of early domestication, riding, and chariotry have reached a wide but to a great extent unquestioning audience.
I consider one of the keystones of this hypothesis: the proposal which has become widely (though not universally) accepted, that
the horses in the Eneolithic settlement of Botai in Kazakhstan were not only domesticated but used to hunt wild horse herds.
In addition to Anthony’s outline of this theory in The Horse the Wheel and Language, I consider the various “evidence” put forward, and I offer counter-arguments to the claims for domestication and riding at that place and time.
I discuss various strands of “evidence”, including: early artefacts interpreted as an indication of domestication, bits, bitting and
toothwear, corrals and dung, horse control an d management, consumption and storage of horse meat, recent DNA findings, the
topography of the area,and analysis of lipids on potsherds. I also make comparisons with the earliest indisputable archaeological
finds of chariot horses in the Sintashta-Petrovka burials in South Russia, dating to the 3rd millennium BCE.
I hope that my conclusion that there is still insufficient convincing evidence to prove that the horses of Botai were either domesticated or ridden, but that they were more likely to have been rounded up and slaughtered for meat by hunters, will lead to further
discussion and research as to when and where horses were first domesticated and exploited.
