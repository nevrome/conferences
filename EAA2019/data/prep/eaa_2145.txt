Secondary Products Revolution (Sherratt 1981) and how they are reflected in Proto-Indo-European. In particular, terminology
pertaining to animal traction will be discussed and compared to the data in the recent archeological literature (e.g. Gaastra et al.
2018). Words for ‘yoke’ and ‘shaft, pole’ can be reconstructed for the earliest layers of Proto-Indo-European. Related words for
‘ox’ are also found in several Indo-European languages, suggesting a common origin. The archaeological evidence for the use of
draught animals and castration sets temporal and perhaps also spatial limits on Proto-Indo-European. It will be investigated to
what extent these limits are in line with the conclusions that Anthony reached in his book.
