Mats, covers for tools and weapons, seldom preserved fibers and textile fragments as well as textile imprints are very important
data for the reconstruction of ancient textile production. Phytolith and isotope data as well as direct 14C dating of textile samples gives the opportunity to reconsider the roles of early woollen textiles in pastoral society of the Eastern Europe. During the
IV and almost all III millennium BC plant fibers were predominant raw material for plating and weaving, i.e. linen in the Caucasus
and Low Don region; stems and leaves of wild reed, sedge, gramineous plants â€“ in the steppe and forest-steppe zone of Eastern
Europe. Textile uncovered in the grave from Novosvobodnaya dating to the 3000 BC is made of wool and cotton fibers, dyed with
tannin and is consider to be imported from some southern regions. Wool fibers and the innovative technology of new type of
textile production appeared in the Caucasus and adjacent areas of the steppe zone only since the second half of the 3000 BC
where it began to be practiced by local weavers who were keeping use plant fibers as well. Only since the beginning of 2000 BC
wool textile and cloth began to spread to the eastern and, probably, to the western European territories. This work was supported
