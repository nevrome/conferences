PANTHEON: TWO CASE STUDIES
Author(s): Massetti, Laura (University of Copenhagen)
Presentation Format: Oral
In his 2007 ground-breaking book, David Anthony points out how religious beliefs and rituals belonging to the neighbors of the
Yamnaya people might have left a trace in the pantheons of Western and Eastern Indo-European traditions: “Western Indo-European religious and ritual practices were female-inclusive, and western Yamnaya people shared a border with the female-figurine-making Tripolye culture: eastern Indo-European rituals and gods, however, were more male-centered, and eastern Yamnaya
people shared borders with northern and eastern foragers who did not make female figurines” (p. 305).
