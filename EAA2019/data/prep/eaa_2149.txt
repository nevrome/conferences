In this paper, I will concentrate on two case-studies of ‘gender differentiation’ in the pantheon of the Indo-European languages,
namely, those of (i) the Sun-deity and (ii) the Fire-deity. I will present the data concerning the realm of action/protection of different god(des)s as well as a sketch of the main narratives/motives associated with their figures and cults.
(i) The Sun deity is male in Indo-Iranian, Greek and Latin, feminine in the Germanic and Baltic. However, in connection with the
motive of the Sun’s wedding, the Sun is mostly associated with the bride, also in Eastern languages. In Vedic, for instance, it’s
Sūrya’s daughter, Sūryā, who marries Soma or the Divine Twins. Is this a clue for a religious feature, which was once connected
with ‘She-Sun’ and was later transplanted in a male-centered pantheon?
(ii) The fire-god(des)’s sphere of action seems to be imagined as very broad and complex. This led to a phenomenon of multiplication and differentiation of the Fire-deities and their divine avatars: the god(des) of the house-hearth (domestic cult and sacrifice), the god(des) of public sacrifice (including funerary rite), the divine smith(s). Is there a way to track down the distribution of
roles within the diverse IE pantheons?
The paper will endeavor to provide an answer to these gender matters.
