Presentation Format: Oral
This interdisciplinary project investigates how domestic space was organized in ancient Greece, focusing on the case study of
Olynthos. The ancient city of Olynthos in Northern Greece was occupied during the 5th and 4th century BC until its complete destruction in 348 BC by Philip II. First excavations in the 1930s revealed over 50 houses preserved in excellent condition. Current
research undertaken by the Olynthos Project aims to study the organization of space and their implications for social relations
within the domestic sphere in more detail.
As part of the wider excavations, this project applies an innovative approach that combines theories, methods and data from
different disciplines, incorporating data from archaeological excavations with micro-scale geoarchaeological analyses. The focus lies on the micromorphological analysis of floors and occupation deposits to reconstruct human activity and site formation
processes. The interpretation of thin sections is supplemented with geochemical analyses (ICP-MS, SEM-EDX, GC-MS) which
allows us to link chemical elements and compounds to specific human activities.
Geoarchaeological data will be integrated with observations from other scales including artefact distribution patterns and textual sources, to overcome limitations of the individual approaches, and enabling us to develop a more holistic understanding of
domestic life in ancient Greece. By integrating multi-scale data from diverse disciplines we face the challenge of presenting our
data in a simple and intelligible way that enables us to communicate geoarchaeological and in particular micromorphological data
to non-specialists, particularly in this period where such an approach is not often applied.
