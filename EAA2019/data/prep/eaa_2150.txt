WOMEN-SOJOURNERS AND MEN-OF-THE-PLACE? THE EVIDENCE FOR INDIVIDUAL MOBILITY IN EARLY
IRON AGE SOUTHWEST GERMANY

Presentation Format: Oral
Motivated in large part by David Anthony’s rehabilitation of migration in archaeological interpretations of social structure and
transformation (1990, 1992, 1997) I published an article 15 years ago on differential mobility in the early Iron Age of southwest
Germany based on excavations in two tumuli near the Heuneburg hillfort (Arnold 2004). This paper revisits differential gendered
mobility in light of the recent completion of the final report of those excavations as well as other evidence for inter- and trans-regional interconnections generated by ongoing projects in the region, including isotope analysis of faunal remains. An unexpectedly large number of burials, not otherwise especially richly outfitted, contain personal ornament and other objects that indicate
connections both westward and across the Alpine passes. The mechanisms by which external influences may have affected
these populations were quite complex and underscore the importance of David Anthony’s call for a more nuanced approach to
individual and group mobility in the past.
