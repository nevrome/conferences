5000 years ago, Europe was fundamentally transformed. From the Volga to the Rhine, Corded Ware Culture rapidly supplanted a
patchwork of indigenous cultures. This culture then persisted for half a millennium across its vast distribution. What processes
resulted in such a swift and durable transformation?
Recent approaches to this question focus on the internal variability of Corded Ware Culture, or changes in ancestry and mobility
during the third millennium BC. However, how does migration result not only in the instigation, but also in the upkeep of uniformity
