for five centuries? And why is Corded Ware recognisable as an entity if it consists of local variability? To address these questions, we offer a complementary perspective of Corded Ware Culture: An archaeology of information.
This stance interprets the uniform practices and material culture of Corded Ware Culture as emergent social conventions. These
uniformities emerge from countless negotiations about the proper course of action between agents who draw on previous experiences and carry results onward to subsequent interactions. Therefore, an analysis of these information exchange can shed
new light on the uniformity of Corded Ware Culture.
We illustrate the potential of this stance with two studies conducted within our department. The first example studies the transmission of ceramic technology during the formation of the Corded Ware and its possible implications for understanding this
change. The second example applies this perspective of information exchange in a practice-based network approach to unravel
the driving factors behind the durable and uniform Corded Ware burial ritual.
