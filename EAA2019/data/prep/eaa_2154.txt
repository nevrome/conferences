Researchers unanimously recognize the migration origins of the Sintashta antiquities of the Southern Urals. However, the composition of the migrant groups and the participation of the local substrate population are widely debated. The archaeological
argument of the migration is a sharp break with the previous local traditions and the emergence of a completely new system of
stereotypes (architecture, funeral rites, material culture). Genetic studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of the anthropology
for the Sintashta population and the similarity of its genotype with Central Europe. At the same time, new radiocarbon dates
show that different traditions existed approximately in one period (the beginning of the second millennium BC). Petrovka, Alakul,
Early Srubnaya (Timber-Grave), Seima-Turbino cultures should be mentioned in this list. Seima-Turbino sites are also considered a
reflection of the migration from east to west. The cause of the paradox (the illusion of the coexistence of many traditions in one
territory), in my opinion, can be explained be a very short period of existence of Sintashta culture and its very rapid transformation into the cultures of the Late Bronze Age.
