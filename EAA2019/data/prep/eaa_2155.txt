BABIES IN THE AEGEAN BATHWATER

The wide rift and the resulting tension between Classics -the wise, elderly brother of ancient studies- and Archaeology -known
for its sophomoric zeal- are well known. It would not be an overstatement, perhaps, to claim that Aegean prehistory is the awkward love child of the aforementioned disciplines, geographically and chronologically connected to both. It is thus inevitable, it
may seem, for Aegean prehistorians not to be affected by theoretical tendencies in humanities in general and world archaeology
in particular.
However, one vein of thought -which has been in recent decades most emphatically represented by Dr. Anthony- has not been a
matter of debate for the archaeologists of the prehistoric Aegean for quite a long time: migration, mobility, babies, and the bathwater. After a troublesome period of the discipline, during which the pendulum always swang towards external stimuli in order
to explain cultural change, the Hegelian response has been understandably severe: “internal, local processes can explain all”.
Unhelpfully, the truth probably lies in the middle. Certain aspects of cultural change, at a given period and location, may be perfectly analysed and comprehended through mechanisms such as emulation or conspicuous consumption, yet population movements may better explain others. As of late, the latter perspective has been unexplored in Aegean prehistory.
In this paper, David Anthony’s theoretical contributions to the study of human mobility will be evaluated in terms of their implications in Aegean prehistory.
