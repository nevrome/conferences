LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY OF INDO-EUROPEAN AND ITS SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION

Eurasia, and hence Indo-European, shows large areas of relative linguistic homogeneity, with few but geographically far-flung language families, while the Americas reveal a rich patchwork of heterogeneity at varying scales and an abundance of small-scale
families and isolates. At the same time, genetic and archaeological evidence shows that both regions were originally populated
from related regions in East Asia, with some influences and migrations continuing into more recent times. How did the differences between Eurasia and the Americas arise, given their shared origins and connections? One group of theories locates the cause
of this in the Americas, positing either rapid, isolated diversification during the initial settlement, accelerated diversification
driven by conscious identity preservation, or incomplete language convergence due to shallow time depths. Another group of
theories locates the cause in Eurasia, positing rapid homogenization in the wake of intensive and repeated contact during the
Holocene. Progress in resolving these questions is hampered by a lack of sufficient resolution in reconstructing the population
history between now and the settlement time, by a lack of spatially and temporally explicit models that combine linguistic and
demographic data, and by controversies about linking archaeological horizons with reconstructed populations and languages
that are difficult to resolve. I will present and discuss an approach that proposes to break out of this impasse by increasing
the historical resolution and scope through the modern genomics of humans and domesticated plants and animals, using the
resultant demographic histories to constrain models of linguistic diffusion in an explicit spatio-temporal framework of evolution
and movement trajectories, and fitting these models not on single families but jointly on multiple families in the same historical
region.
