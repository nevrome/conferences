Presentation Format: Oral
Nomads from the steppes have hovered over prehistoric European archaeology for decades. I began to study steppe archaeology in order to untangle the threads that V Gordon Childe and Marija Gimbutas had explored with inadequate data and faulty
models. One thread was the domestication of the horse, which Dorcas Brown and I approached decades ago by studying microwear caused by organic bits on horse teeth at Dereivka and Botai, but which we are now able to examine in an entirely new way
through ancient horse DNA with collaborators led by Ludovic Orlando. Another thread was the study of human migrations, which
I attempted to examine (1990) through processual models borrowed from sociology and demography, now also revolutionized
by the recovery of ancient DNA, which has revealed massive migrations from the steppes in the 3rd millennium BC. The Samara
Valley Project 1995-2002, co-directed with Dorcas Brown and Russian colleagues, studied the role of agriculture in the evolution of steppe pastoralism. Today we finally are beginning to have the data necessary to integrate the study of Indo-European
linguistic origins with correlated data in the fields of ancient human and animal DNA, migration studies, and the evolution of
steppe economies and political systems in order to accomplish a level of interdisciplinary understanding that was absent in the
days of Gimbutas.
