Present-day church-goers in many of the oldest churches in Finland are often unaware of the mummified human remains beneath
their feet. The once so popular practice of burying under church floors has vanished from the social memory. Nevertheless, until
the late 18th century, most members of elite were buried under church floors. At the time the custom was sure to stay fresh in
parishioners’ minds, particularly during the summer, due to the permeating odor of decaying human flesh. A rich, multi-dimensional belief system existed behind the practice. In Finnish folklore a number of stories hint that mummification was not understood as a natural process. A common belief was that the church was filled with “Church people”, the deceased, who controlled
the churches at night. Funerary attire and small items the likes of coins wrapped in paper or textile, wood chips, brooms, and small
coffins for frogs were slipped under floors to expel evil or to cast spells. Thus, depositing the deceased under floors inside family
owned chambers was not simply a way to conveniently dispose human remains, although at the northernmost latitudes, in winter, when the ground was frozen, it may even have served as the most practical solution. By the 18th century, the premises under
churches were packed full with corpses decomposed in varying degree. Despite the multifaceted beliefs, to clear under-floor
spaces, the older remains of particularly non-relatives were often handled in rather cruel ways.
