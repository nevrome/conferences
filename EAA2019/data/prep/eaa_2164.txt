This paper focuses on the smell of death produced by church burials. During the 17th and 18th centuries, when burying the
deceased under the church floors was common, rotting corpses often created uninviting smell scape in the churches especially
during the warmer summer months. The terrible smell led to solutions to have services outside on the churchyards to avoid sitting inside on the church benches in the fumes.
Certain odour plants were used when placing the deceased in the coffins in funeral and also during the services at the church.
The fear of miasma, the idea of diseases spreading through foul smells, together with crowded space under the floors inflicted
the burial tradition that was gradually abandoned in individual congregations. Since the late 18th century the under church floor
burials have been forgotten in many churches. Changes in the conditions of the churches, such as new heating systems, have
brought them to common awareness. After centuries, the partly mummified human remains are in many churches considered a
source of putrid smell and health hazard again.
