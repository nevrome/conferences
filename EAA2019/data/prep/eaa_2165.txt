Presentation Format: Oral
There has been a lively debate for years if there is a tradition of intentional mummification in Christian Middle Europe. Especially
from the early modern period there are hundreds of dry mummies of a social elite preserved in family- and churchvaults. Well
ventilated and therefore dry crypt spaces are in most of these cases the reason behind their natural mummification.
Besides the dynastic and representative nature the vaults with their properly sealed coffins were possibly understood as protection spaces for a more facilitated resurrection at the day of judgement. Physical resurrection was church-dogmatical as well
as private religious fact from the beginning of Christianity till the 20th century. Numerous inscriptions on coffins and vault walls
testify the hope of a „joyful resurrection“.
Resurrection believe is common for all confessions, perhaps protestantism even promoted crypt burials. But only the understanding of the interaction between different social and religious aspects opens up access to the entity „vault“. The lecture
shows for the first time how these factors could be linked in contemporary research.
