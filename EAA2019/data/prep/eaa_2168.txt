AND CURRENT STATE OF RESEARCH

As for Southwestern Germany and Swabia crypt burials can be regarded as terra incognita: scientific research never systematically concentrated on this topic except for the excavation of the seventeenth century burials of the Dukes of Sulz in Tiengen,
High-Rhine area. There is seldom any public, museal or touristic display. Preservation activities of historical monuments are excluding them frequently.
In many cases it is not clear how old these crypts or vaults are and which architectural schemes and types existed. In addition
there are difficulties in defining what a crypt burial is actually. Evidences of masoned sepultures are dating back to the late
Middle Ages and they are connected to nobility, clergy and bourgeoisie. It seems that those structures that were located infra
ecclesiam (inside churches), could have had a wide spectrum of construction. They were not accessible and only made for the
deposition of coffins.
Since the 16th century there are much more records of vaults. In connection with Reformation, Catholic Reform and Confessionalization they were closely connected with buildings of churches and pre-determined them in some cases. For example the
new construction of the St.-Martins-Church in Messkirch was from 1526 onwards be geared to the vault of the Dukes of Zimmern. Other Princes imitated the Habsburgs and established in the sign of post-trident Catholicism vaults in monasteries like the
Dukes of Königsegg in the Chapuchin-Church of Immenstadt.
