traces of past activities, decipher formation processes, reconstruct technologies and identify choices in the use of material
resources. However, while providing localised and/or diachronic high-resolution observations, the small size of thin sections and
the sampling strategies (mainly targeting exposed sections) do not allow to fully explore the spatial dimension of the built environment. In this paper, I will discuss the potential and limits of an approach, based on an intra-room spatial analysis, adopted for
my PhD research in the site of Arslantepe (Malatya, Turkey). Here, an impressive sequence of superimposed occupation levels
has been exposed over the course of more than 50 years of excavations, providing the opportunity for a systematic and detailed
investigation of its earthen buildings. This research targeted four rooms that presented the best-preserved floors. The aim was
to investigate the related nature of features and activities that constitute the lived space, in order to gain insights into the social
relations that are recursively linked with those spatial structures. For this purpose, multiple micromorphological blocks were
collected from different parts of these floors, to evenly cover each area and detect possible variations throughout the space.
In addition, small quantities of loose sediment for spot-test analyses (proteins, pH, carbohydrates, carbonates, phosphates and
fatty acids) were taken at equal intervals of 50cm and integrated with the micromorphological observations. Ultimately, the spatial interpolation of the results provided arguments to move beyond punctual observations and to transpose the interpretation
from a micro- to a meso-scale, allowing to better understand the relationship between the built environment and the people that
physically interacted with it.
