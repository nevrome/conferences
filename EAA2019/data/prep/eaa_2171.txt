Presentation Format: Oral
Throughout the centuries the royal burial vaults of central Europe such as those belonging to the houses of Habsburg, Wittelsbach, Württemberg, Thurn and Taxis, Zähringen, Hohenzollern, etc. experienced the addition and reorganization of coffins
within the crypt, destruction, and renovation and reconstruction. This paper discusses the diverging processes that influenced
the style of coffins, coffin iconography, as well as the arrangement of coffins within the crypts and identifies similarities and
differences between them. The style and symbolism on the coffins can usually be attributed to ideology and fashion but other
processes were also at work within the burial vaults. Family ties and family size and the continuation or disruption of blood lines
are the major causes for abandonment or enlargement of crypts, political conditions were often responsible for destruction and
exhumation. The phenomenon of crypt visits, both past and present, and the identity of some of the visitors to the burial vaults
will also be discussed.
