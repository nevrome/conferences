Presentation Format: Oral
Researching crypts – the tombs of Russia’s elite of the Tsarist era, and the difficulties of excavating them, and cooperation
with the secular and ecclesiastical communities - studies were conducted by the IA of RAS at the historic cemetery of Russia’s
largest monastery, the Trinity-St Sergius Lavra. Research centred on the cemetery of Moscow Academy of Divinity – Russia’s
foremost institution of religious education.
Problems arise from the tombs in the cemetery being destroyed over the 1920s-30s, during the USSR’s struggle against religion.
The Academy’s authorities wished to locate the burials of the most prominent of the professors
Research began in the archives, alongside comprehensive geophysical (radar and magnetometric) surveys. Three burials rows
were identified, which did not correspond to archival materials. However, archaeological excavation confirmed the geophysical
findings.
Excavations uncovered and identified 32 burials. Age and gender of the deceased were determined, with non-destructive anatomical studies perfomed using laser 3D scanning and photogrammetry, in addition to microfocus X-ray diffraction.
Important data was retrieved by study of their apparel -including, for example, the buttons of their uniforms.
Forensic examination compared period photographs of the teaching staff with skulls retrieved during excavation, using an overlay technique.
