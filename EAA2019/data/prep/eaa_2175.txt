Presentation Format: Poster
Both animal remains and plant fragments in graves tell a lot about the ceremony, burial circumstances and the deceased. They
also report events after burial; how the mummification or purification process has progressed or what happened in and outside the coffin after burial. This poster focuses on the following questions; What plant species did people put into coffins and
what happens after the burials? What insect species are found? The discussion concerns the church graves dating to 17th- to
19th-century Tornio, Keminmaa, Haukipudas, Oulu, Hailuoto and Kempele. The area seems to have typical Swedish and Nordic
features, but indicators of locality and migration can be seen as well. For example, the use of birch bark is distinct in the rural island of Hailuoto. Like regular gardens, these “coffin gardens” reflect the cultural and natural environments around them. Coffins
were filled with plants and fragrances. They mirrored the Garden of Eden, in a sense. Everyday life and feasts were visible in burial
ceremonies as much as practice and symbolism. Traditional manners held their role in the community while new trends arrived.
