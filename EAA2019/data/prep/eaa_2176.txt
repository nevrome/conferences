EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY COFFINS - “BIOGRAPHY OF THINGS”

In recent years, work has been intensified in churches and cemeteries. Archaeological excavations often reveal burials in coffins.
Contrary to what the term ”biography of things” may suggest, the theoretical approach referred to as this does not only apply
to the material aspects of objects. More than the physical description of material culture (e.g. shape, color, dimensions of a
given object), the biography of things focuses on the multiplicity, variability and diversity of the meanings of things (and places)
throughout history.
The variety of coffins inspired me to develop them in a very broad context. I set the following aims:
•
cognitive aim - documenting (descriptive, photographic, drawing) of a unique archaeological legacy of modern funeral
rites, one of the material manifestations being wooden coffins, elaboration and making the results available to a wider
audience;
•
methodological aim - the use of archaeological research methods that could be used in the study of modern funeral
rites through the use of integrated procedures for obtaining archaeological sources, both in situ and with minimal
interference in their structure and their analysis;
•
community aim - identification of burials on the basis of coffins and preservation of the memory of the deceased, whose existence in social consciousness and values assigned to them serve to maintain individual and collective identity.
Can such a study be called a biography? What problems did I struggle with and which aspects did I neglect to do research on? And
all this on the example of coffins from the church crypts in Szczuczyn (Poland).
