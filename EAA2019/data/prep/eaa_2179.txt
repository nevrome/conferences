ISLAMIZATION BEYOND CONVERSION TO ISLAM
Author(s): Carvajal Lopez, Jose (University of Leicester)
Presentation Format: Oral
In this presentation I propose to reconsider the concept of Islamization to get over the idea of religious conversion. Archaeologists have not developed their own approach to the concept of Islamization in spite of having the conceptual tools to do so since
at least the 1990s. They have instead considered the concept as associated to the idea of individual conversion to Islam, as it
has traditionally been done in the field of humanities. However, this ultimately leads to a paradox, because there is no way that
individual identities can be explained with reference to rational individual choices.
I will explore the ways in which the study of conversion has inexorably led to a consideration of Islamization as socialization, in
spite of not abandoning the idea of individual conversion as the ultimate causal element of Islamization. My suggestion is that
we should abandon the concern with the link between Islamization and conversion and that we should explore the ways in which
archaeological theory can approach Islamization in a post-colonial and post-Orientalist framework.
