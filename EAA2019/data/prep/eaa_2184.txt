MUSLIMS ON THE MARGINS? ISLAMICATE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE WESTERN EURASIAN STEPPE

Archaeology as a discipline with its Eurocentric past continues to be plagued by nationalist discourses and political agendas.
Their aim is to push the material presence of Islam out of sight to the margins of the mainstream historical narrative. Yet, in many
cases archaeology represents the only means of learning about the Islamic conversion or the existence of Muslim communities
in a territory marked by the absence of medieval texts. The medieval Western Eurasian Steppe with its predominantly mobile
communities of pastoral nomads is precisely such a region. There, the archaeological material culture derived mainly from mortuary contexts reveals a complex set of indigenous ritual practices that gradually become transformed by the encounter with Islam
by the 10th century CE. The archaeological visibility of this process cannot be denied, but archaeological interpretation—and
its subsequent integration into the mainstream historical narratives—continues to relegate nomadic Muslims to the margins of
history. In this paper, I would like to address a number of such cases, where the archaeological interpretation of medieval nomadic
graves from the Caspian-Pontic steppe has led to heated polemics whereby their Muslim attribution is downplayed and ignored.
A comparative approach will be used in order to contextualize these polemics and archaeological cases.
