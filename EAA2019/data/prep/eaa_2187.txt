sanitary sewer system sufficiently proved an efficient management of wastewater and its maintenance through the centuries.
In addition, monumental buildings as the interpreted as a ‘funduq’, prove the economic importance of the arrabal. In the limit of
the site, there is an oratory where was found a small ‘maqbara’ next to it.
The recently created project “San Esteban Archaeological site” (http://sanesteban.um.es/) started an interdisciplinary research
thanks to the collaboration between the University of Murcia and the City Hall. The principal aim was to sustain the excavation in
order to examine the remains of the most extensive medieval site discovered in Europe through the most recent archaeological
techniques. Various archaeological disciplines and bioarchaeological analyses are combined to compare the results obtained
on the written sources. A more precise understanding of the organization of these areas outside the walls in Islamic cities and
some new hypotheses about its functioning are expected. The project is also a complement to the teaching program addressed
to Bachelor’s degree and Master students.
