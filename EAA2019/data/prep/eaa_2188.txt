Presentation Format: Oral
In the early periods of Islam in Anatolia, from the 12th century to the 14th century, the Islamic contexts was determined by
heterodoxic phenomena based on the Anatolian and Central Asian shamanistic traditions. In this period, the heterodoxic Islamic
practices impinged upon material culture of the new converted or coming Islamic communities in the Medieval Anatolia. These
esoteric currents demonstrated themselves as natural symbolisations and spolia on the material culture. These practises and
currents were transferred from Anatolia to the South-eastern Europe by Ottoman expansion. In this expansion, the heterodox
Turkmen religious leaders played crucial role to found a new colonization area with these heterodoxic practises in the European
Islam. This paper will be focused on heterodoxy and its unique Islamic practises on material culture, especially architectural
elements and religious materials, in the Medieval Western Anatolia and the Balkans through the archaeological perspectives.
The archaeological survey about these phenomena will contribute to understand current local European Islamic contexts in the
Balkans.
