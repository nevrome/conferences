Russian architecture of the 12th c. borrowed its ornamentation from Lombardy or Palatinate. The churches were embellished by
the small arches-and-columns belt and freely placed decorative, or the full carpet pattern. After the Mongol invasion and up to
the late 13th c. Russians erected almost no monumental constructions. Churches of the 14th c. did not survive. And the cathedrals of the early 15th c. look quite unexpectedly. The composition is extremely simple: facades are divided by the three carved
bands placed between the two levels of windows, at apses and the drum. The motif of the carving is vegetation.
The idea of the paper is to understand the genesis of this ornamentation. Its Oriental character is evident and an attempt to
explain it as the transfer from the Seljuk art was made long ago. But it was not accepted in Russia. The new materials of Anatolia
are able to support the idea of the Oriental transfer and to draw the itinerary of it. The nearest spring of the motifs is located in
the region of the former Byzantine state densely populated by the Armenians and Greeks of the Inner Anatolia of the 13th-14th
cc. (Susuz Han, Nigde, Kayseri of Cappadocia). Rare examples could be found at Jerusalem (Turbat Turkhan-Katun, mid 14th c.)
and in Cairo, were they are connected with the Seljuk patrons. One of the motifs is well known arabesque, originated at the Far
East and brought to the Mediterranean world by the Nomads. The road from the Seljuk Anatolia to Orthodox Moscow led through
the architecture of the Crimea. In the 14-15th cc. it was an important part of the Golden Horde and Genoese Mediterranean trade.
