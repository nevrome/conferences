the Neolithic, the quantity of human burials in the Levant appears to have increased. Are they only there to mark the settlement
of communities on a specific territory? Observations of contextual, funeral and biological data suggests that the dead are not
as passive as they appear. The treatment of the corpse is revealing of the new place that the deceased occupied in the society.
The removal of the skulls and their subsequent treatment (grouping, pigmentation, plastering) are not the only witnesses to the
profound changes that took place. From the Natufian onwards, there was a redistribution of social roles where the (selected)
deceased take an increasingly important place. The complexity of the funeral gestures adopted, testifies to the importance and
diversity of the roles the living community assigned to them. Moreover, a close link of interdependence can be seen between
burials, houses and other structures. Thus, the deceased seem to serve as identity reference points during the repositioning of
human societies in their environment and belief system. This paper will present examples to illustrate this point and highlight
