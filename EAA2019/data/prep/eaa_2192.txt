After the Ottomans captured Podolia for 27 years (1672-1699), the Turks owned the province. An ejleth was created with the
center in the city of Kamenets-Podolsky and the main castles were seized, where Turkish garrisons stood. Castle towers and
monasteries rebuilt into minarets. Gradually, Turkish culture penetrated Ukrainian life and its manifestations are especially noticeable in ceramics. During the excavations of cities and castles in Podolia, fragments of pottery from Turkish ceramic centers
(Kütahya) are often found. Jugs with spout, washstands and plates with wide shores decorated with abstract multicolor ornamental motifs inherent in Islamic cultures (“marble” ornament). Such dishes are found on all monuments during archaeological
excavations in Podolia. In the 18th century, this ornamental motif spreads throughout Ukraine and becomes national. Attention
should be paid to the manufacture of pipes, where the fusion of European and Islamic cultures is combined. During the excavations in Kamenets-Podolsky, a cradle was found with a Turkish stamp from one side and a gentry coat of arms from the other side
and the inscription “Satans”. The influence of Turkish culture is reflected in the ornamentation of tiles of this period. Thus, we can
say that Turkish culture spread among the Ukrainian people and was processed to suit their tastes.
