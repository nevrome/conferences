INTRODUCTION: ROMAN NATURE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
Author(s): Mandich, Matthew (ISAR)
Presentation Format: Oral
In the last two decades the current, unprecedented environmental crisis has led many scholars to radically rethink the anthropocentric model of Empire, centred on the control of ideology, politics, economics and the military, and instead acknowledge the
central role played by nature in shaping social power (e.g. Elvin & Tsâ€™ui-jung 1998; Mikhail 2013). At the same time, the scientific
validation of the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene, dramatically confirmed the overwhelming and irreversible influence that human activities have on our planet. When this new epoch
began is highly debatable, but huge environmental impacts from human activity certainly occurred in the Roman period due to
the increased scale of urbanisation, production, and consumption. Given the growing awareness of the indelible mark we make
on the planet, this panel will look back at one of the largest power networks of the past, the Roman Empire, to re-examine Roman
perceptions of nature, power, and power over nature to help us better understand our present situation. By offering a lively and
challenging setting for discussion from nature writers like Robert Macfarlane to Roman scholars like Kyle Harper, the panel will
foster new approaches to explain the relationship between human societies and their natural environments, providing a novel
interpretative framework for current and past environmental crises.
