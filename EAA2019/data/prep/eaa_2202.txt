site showed the interval between 22.000 and 20.000 years BP (non cal). Most of researchers attributed Gagarino as the site of
Eastern Gravettian and particularly Kostenki-Avdeevo culture despite of original features of its inventory.
In this research the bone industry of the site Gagarino have studied in complex for the first time. The inventory includes fragments of faunal remains with the traces of processing, artefacts made of bone and ivory on different stages of production,
which reflect household (needles, awls, smoothers, spatulas), hunting (points) and symbolic (personal ornaments, female and
anthropomorphic double statuettes) sides of life. Technological and typological analysis have demonstrated the wide range of
tools assemblage and variable technics of processing raw materials. The percentage of ivory artefacts is rather high. Most of female figurines are related to special Khotylevo-Gagarino type. On the one hand, considering relatively small size of the collection
and frames of one dwelling, subjects of mobile art are prevailed in the collection, but on the other hand, there are practically no
household and hunting tools with elements of ornamentation or figure decoration.
Thus, the results of the research showed that the developing level of processing raw materials and the range of categories in
bone and ivory inventory are stayed in frames of common technologies of Kostenki-Avdeevo culture and the Eastern Gravettian
in general, however, its look have differences, originality and unique features.
