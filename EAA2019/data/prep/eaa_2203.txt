Presentation Format: Oral
Samshvilde, a settlement in southern Georgia, is a complex and multi-period archaeological site. The site occupies a strategic
and impregnable location on a basalt cape flanked by the gorges of the Khrami and Chivchava rivers. This distinctive landscape
position, combined with environmental conditions that include a mild climate and an abundance of natural resources, have attracted human occupation for millennia. Samshvilde and its surroundings have been inhabited since the Neolithic era; In Bronze
period the area was used by people as a settlement and a cemetery. But the urban complex of the site increased mainly to the
medieval period, when it became the region’s main fortress and political-economic center. Proximity to the northern branch of
the Silk Road further increased the site’s importance. Samshvilde was therefore a place where various ethnic groups and cultures converged. In the early six century Sasanians were replaced by Arabians, while from the ninth century the site fell under
the influence of Armenian kingdom of Ani. During the late medieval period Georgian, Persian and Ottoman cultures were replacing
each other. Anyway, despite the site’s importance and such a longevity, until recently there has been little concerted archaeological study of Samshvilde. In 2012 the Samshvilde Archaeological Expedition was initiated by the University of Georgia which has
taken a multi-disciplinary approach to the site. The cultural changes during the centuries, new archaeological contexts and artifacts will be presented, as well as the main approaches, the results of interdisciplinary studies and the challenges of the project.
