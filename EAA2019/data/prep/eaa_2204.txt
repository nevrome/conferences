DISSOLVING LITURGY FROM MONUMENTS – THE CASE OF CAROLINGIAN CHANCEL SCREENS

Presentation Format: Oral
Decorated chancel screens guiding movement in the interior space of churches and partly equipped with curtains to control
the view between the nave and the choir were common features in Roman churches from the 4th century onwards and material
expressions of the processional conduct of a specific liturgy in the city of Rome. The number of churches furnished with chancel screens exploded during the 8th and 9th centuries, when they became common features not only in Central and Northern
Italy and the Adriatic, but also north of the Alps and in parts of Gaul. Frequently this seemingly vast and quick spread of chancel
screens is connected to the reform of liturgy in the Frankish empire, which deliberately adopted the Roman liturgy including the
processions within and between several churches.
But taking a closer look on the distribution of chancel screens in comparison to the main area of liturgical reform as mirrored in
the distribution of revised liturgical textbooks both areas seem to be mutually exclusive, while other regions like the diocese of
Milano, which deliberately stayed with its own traditional liturgy, are densely doted with chancel screens. This observation raises
various questions: Were – in the perception of the Carolingians – chancel screens connected to a specific type of liturgy at all?
If not, why did they spread just around the second half of the 8th century? And what did the Carolingians perceive as typical of
the Roman liturgy?
