Presentation Format: Oral
This paper considers the theoretical efficacy and practical limitations of Hawkins’ ”Stonehenge as Neolithic computer” interpretation in light of “numerical artifacts” revealed by archaeology (Hawkins 1964, 1967; Colton and Martin 1967; Dibble 1976; Hoyle
1977; Ranieri 2003; Malstrőm 2011). For example, at least ten (including two previously unpublished) “numerical artifacts” in the
architecture of Stonehenge are consistent with systematic observation of the sun and moon on the local horizon, e.g.: latitude;
rational right triangle; number/placement of archaeological features; and reciprocal luni-solar horizon vectors.
The research objectives are: (1) to enumerate the numerical artifacts in Stonehenge’s architectural design capable of recording the Lunar Synodic Period (29.53 days), Regression of the Lunar Nodes Period (18.601 years), Metonic (19-year) Cycle,
and “Stonehenge 56-Year” (lunar node regression/eclipse) Cycle (Hawkins 1967); and (2) to test the utility and limitations of
