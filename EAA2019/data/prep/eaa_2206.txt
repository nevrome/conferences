Hawkins’ eclipse warning hypothesis with NASA solar and lunar eclipse data (Espenak 2016) and Starry Night Pro Plus-6 digital
simulation (cf. Malstrőm 2011). For example, if the 56-Year Cycle correctly predicts more often than not that a midwinter (winter
solstice +/-15 days) lunar eclipse will be visible after the full moon rises in the same horizon position at 19:18:19-year intervals,
then it would be more reasonable than not that the architects of Stonehenge had knowledge of both the 19-year Metonic Cycle
(lunar phases) and 56-year Cycle (regression of the lunar nodes) as evidenced by the 19 stones of the Bluestone Horseshoe and
56 holes of the Aubrey circle (Hawkins 1965, 178). The significance of the proposed research is to offer a rationale for major/
minor lunar standstill alignments (cf. Schaeffer 2007) found in Bronze Age religious architecture (e.g., ziggurats; Tiede 2018) and
numerical artifacts in Bronze Age astronomical records (e.g., cuneiform tablets; Neugebauer 1955; Friberg 1981, 2005; Sachs
& Hunger 1988-2006).
