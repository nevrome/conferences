Presentation Format: Oral
Temporal rhythms, such as dormancy, vernalization and germination or birthing seasons, growth or lactation periods as well as
harvest seasons, are inherent to all living beings. While hunter-gatherer ways of life require only the knowledge of such cycles,
subsistence based on plant cultivation and animal husbandry is often associated with the active modification and appropriation
of these natural rhythms for human benefit. So far, however, investigation of the effects of domestication in the Southwestern
Asian to European trajectory of Neolithization has focused on more tangible aspects like size and yield. Changes to the Eigenzeit of the domesticates involved are now researched as a project within the framework of the new Einstein Centre Chronoi in
Berlin dedicated to investigating time and related aspects such as awareness of time, time management, time reckoning and
temporality in the cultures in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary formats. The paper draws attention to ways the perception
of time, speed and rhythm may have changed in early farmers when they knowingly and unknowingly manipulated the timing of
their domesticates - plants, animals or even microbes.
