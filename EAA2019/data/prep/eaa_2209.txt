Researchers interested in the evolution of language and cognition have been studying handedness through the archaeological
record, as it appears to be related to the hemispheric lateralization of language processing centers in the brain. Previous studies

axis, hackles, ripples, eraillure scars, structure and inclination of the striking platform, location of the impact point, and fractures
on broken flakes. However, replication studies have been unsuccessful at validating original claims. This pilot study investigates
