BEYOND

Since Jacques Cauvin first proposed the Neolithisation concept, scholars have lauded this framework for broadening the scope
of agricultural origins research. Rather than simply seeking to correlate climate changes and human responses, archaeologists
now undertake more holistic assessments of changing social values and beliefs, and probe interactions between social spheres,
economic choices, and the local environments in which change unfolded. Storage is a key variable in understanding how the process of ‘Neolithisation’ may or may not have progressed in a particular area, because it relates to both a) economic/subsistence
needs that in turn are shaped by environmental conditions, and b) social values (such as sharing or ownership) and social desires
(such as predictable access to ingredients for larger gatherings or ceremonies). Using ethnoarchaeological examples, this paper
first explores the ways in which cultural and environmental variables may both influence human choices of storage methods,
as people weigh practical needs vs. social consequences. Second, the paper examines diachronic and geographic variation in
methods of storage seen in the archaeological record - using a notable example from Sai Island and other examples situated in
Egypt and Sudan from Final Pleistocene to Middle Holocene times - and considers the ways human choices in these contexts
may have articulated with environmental, economic, and social changes. Finally, the paper uses archaeological examples from
other regions (eastern Africa, Mississippi Valley in North America) to probe factors that may limit the Neolithisation process.
