iterranean region) investigates the transformation processes between 9th - 12th cent AD in the Colline Metallifere District
(CMD), southern Tuscany, in the framework of the new, broader system of trade and cultural exchanges between northern and
southern Europe. nEU-Med integrates archaeology, archaeometallurgy, geoarchaeology, archaeobotany, physical anthropology,
and physical chemistry. Excavations on “mining castles” of the CMD (Rocca San Silvestro, Rocchette Pannocchieschi, Montieri,
Cugnano) demonstrated that the development of local seigneurships in this geographical context was deeply linked to controlling and exploiting polymetallic Cu-Pb-Ag ores. These were mined at least since the 11th-12th cent AD, as testified by historical documents and abundant heaps of metallurgical slags (dated to 11th–14th centuries), found within mining castles. Their
supposed use for coinage remains still uncertain. Numismatic, chemical and lead isotope analyses (LIA) of coins circulating in the
CMD between 9th and 12th-13th century AD address these questions. LIA on ca. 140 silver and silver-copper coins from different mints (Pavia, Lucca, Siena and Pisa) were compared with isotope compositional fields of historical mining districts: Tuscany
(CMD, Apuane Alps), Aquitaine (Melle), Rhenish Massif, Harz, and Erzgebirge. The conclusions narrow the possible metal sources
used for coins circulating in the CMD between 9th and 12th-13th century AD.
