Prominent models of modern human expansions from Africa and across Asia emerged at the turn of the millennium that have prioritised coastal corridors of dispersal, arguing that it would required a single ecological adaptation to maritime habitats. Over the
past 20 years, the absence of any direct archaeological evidence to support such models has been striking, whereas arguments
for a shared cultural origin for microlithic technologies in southern Africa and South Asia (a key component of such models) have
been directly assessed and rejected. GIS-based models have illustrated the plausibility of coastal corridors of expansion around
the South Asian coastline in the Late Pleistocene, but also indicate the high probability of dispersals along river valleys into the
interior of the Indian subcontinent, where the majority of Palaeolithic sites are found. We have undertaken the first dedicated
Palaeolithic survey of coastal Kachchh, India, located immediately east of the Indus delta and at a key biogeographic threshold
marking the end of the Saharo-Arabian deserts and the start of the Monsoonal realm. Here, we present the results of survey
and excavations integrated with palaeoenvironmental evidence for Late Pleistocene occupations that demonstrate Palaeolithic
engagement with coastal landscapes in India.
