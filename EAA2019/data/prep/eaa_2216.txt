THE PRESENTATION, INTERPRETATION AND CONSERVATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HERITAGE
SITES: TRANSNATIONAL, DIACHRONIC AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES. PART 2
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Jäggi, Carola - Besse, Marie (Scientific Committee)
Format: Regular session
This session incorporates papers that are dealing with various archaeological sites from the Paleolithic to the medieval period,
allowing a comparative view of diachronic and transnational trends on human lifestyles and traditions. The understanding of
cultural change is key question of different multidisciplinary approaches, ranging from archaeozoological and technological to
literary and landscape studies.
In addition, we are welcoming studies on preventive archaeology and conservation of archaeological heritage sites across countries, which involve conventional or modern documentation techniques. An important aspect is how the value of these sites is
communicated to the general public, especially in times of crises.
