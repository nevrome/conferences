The fieldwork at the site “Quedlinburg I” (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) combined two archaeological excavation techniques: the
creation of artificial layers as well as digging for strata. The application of (3D) surveying methods – tachymetry and Structure
from Motion / photogrammetry – enabled the digital documentation of the excavated surfaces of archaeological and geological
structures.
The creation of detailed 3D models of the complex Neolithic structures, which integrates “traditional” documentation methods,
facilitates a variety of resultant analyses: In depth-study of the cross-sections of the ditch provided evidence of its construction and several recutting phases. Volume calculations of the backfilling enabled to assess the find distribution in relation to
the depth of the ditch. Examining the different strata and their slope angles provided evidence of past aboveground structures,
such as ramparts, flanking the ditches.
Furthermore, visualisation has always been an important part of archaeological work. Modern technology does not only give us
the tools to process data but also to create accessibility to our results. Therefore, we created 3D models of the circular ditch
enclosure that can be viewed without any special resources.
Thus, the reconstruction of complex stratigraphic contexts of features, strata and/or finds and its visualisation based on methodically heterogeneous documentation is feasible and reasonable.
In the research project “Built Knowledge” the synthesis of archaeological fieldwork and applied digital (3D) survey methods is significant for the interpretation and visualisation of archaeological features. So far, the excavations at the enclosure “Quedlinburg
I” revealed most of its conception and building history.
