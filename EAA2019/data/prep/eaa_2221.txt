Aerial photography is of major use for landscape archaeology. The Netherlands no longer has a basic infrastructure in place for
aerial photography in archaeology. It is thought to be outdated due to the wide variety of possibilities offered by LiDAR technologies for tracing and mapping potential archaeological sites. Newfound interest into ‘aerial archaeology’ was sparked during
the summer of 2018, when the country experienced a drought. Old features within the landscape became visible and enthused
numerous (para)gliders and a KLM-pilot to take photographs. The following research has shown that there is public interest and
academic value in reestablishing such basic infrastructure. Moreover, we see various opportunities that may very well lead to
policy innovations in archaeological heritage management. We are presently assessing ways in how this could be done, while at
the same time establishing how this serves modern heritage approaches. The future infrastructure needs to take into account
the public participation, the automation of the analysis of (satellite) imagery, and the implementation of landscape coherence in
the basics of archaeological heritage management complementing the site level. It is essential to base this infrastructure on the
public participation of (para)gliders and drone pilots, who initiated the preliminary research.
