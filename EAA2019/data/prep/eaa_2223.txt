“Like films & books video games are cultural texts. They say something about the society in which they were made” (Knoblauch
2015:187)
Since decades digital games are on a cultural conquest in becoming the “Leitmedium” of a century. This particular form of media
diffuses through borders of gender, culture and socio-economical strata of any country. The importance for the field of archaeology to participate in the issue of establishing a proper way to deal with this medium is unquestionable. We are facing the
emergence of an enormous amount of data in form of Digital Heritage through those games which already started to decompose.
Therefore, archaeologists and anthropologists have already begun their work on creating approaches to excavate and analyse
digital games to not just preserve those digital sites but also to define their cultural significance.
My talk tries to highlight the chances and possibilities but also the shortcomings of approaches like Andrew Reinhard’s Archaeogaming and the general idea of reading digital games as contemporary artefacts. For that I intend to use the case of the ATARI
Game Burial in 2014 and my own experiences in the game Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey in which I applied several approaches of
pioneering scholars in this new emerging field to illustrate methodological issues and theoretical conflicts (temporality, materiality & ontology) between the current scientific framework of Archaeology and its application on digital heritage in the case of
digital games.
