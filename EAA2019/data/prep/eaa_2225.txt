hibit this type of structures, we created a protective layer with the same recycled materials from the excavation itself, using the
same construction techniques as the ancient Egyptians. Many mud bricks with interesting marks are allowing a study on various
construction stages, techniques and organization of the builders of this temple. To build the protective layer, we use the skills
and the materials of the local building tradition. This choice improves the relationship between the archaeological scientific
team, with the local people working thogether, and this item is the main factor for the conservation of the archaeological site.
