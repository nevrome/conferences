CHANGING MATERIALITIES IN A MEDITERRANEAN TOWN

A sense of historicity is one of major narratives of modernity. This epoch went at great lengths to constitute a form of subjectivity where the past has a major role. Hence, history is not discovered but rather invented, constructed and mobilized in an effort to
construct a certain form of identity appropriate for a particular form of collectivity (the Nation). However, these processes occur,
not only at a discursive level in terms of ideas and ideologies but at the level of material practices as well.
Zadar is a midlevel, historic town situated at the eastern Adriatic coast. During the WWII it suffered devastating destruction
during several bombing campaigns. A major renewal project was undertaken by the authorities, building the whole town practically anew. The remains of the past were not treated as isolated items to be adored as monuments. On the contrary, they were
deliberately and consciously integrated in the fabric of the new city. Therefore, the monuments were contextualized in a such a
manner as to become a part of peopleâ€™s everyday lives.
Whereas modernity strived to constitute a totalizing living experience for a great number of people, the processes which are taking place recently go in a completely different direction. The experience of a historic town now seems fragmented by comparison,
reducing the town to a set of atomized practices. The town is tailored to suit individuated needs most appropriate in the context
of tourism. These issues will be demonstrated on a case study of Zadar, a historic Mediterranean town.
