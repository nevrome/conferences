Presentation Format: Oral
Scholars on both sides of the Sinai Peninsula have considered the Fayum Neolithic in Egypt as a counterpart in the cultural interaction between the southern Levant and northeastern Africa at the time of Neolithisation in the Earlyâ€“Middle Holocene. However, as their understanding of the Fayum Neolithic was not deep enough, their comparison of the material culture of both regions
has tended to be superficial, failing to bridge a chronological gap between these regions. This paper will present a more detailed
picture of various stone tools of the Fayum Neolithic that was gained through a recent restudy of the old lithic collections made
in the early 20th century and currently housed in museums. It will also discuss the local development and Levantine influence
seen in the lithic technology in the Fayum, and reconsider when and how Southwest Asian domesticates and the technical knowhow of dealing with them were brought to the Fayum.
