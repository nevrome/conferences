stakeholders in the benefit of archaeological heritage and opportunities and constrains for developing a professional carrer in
archaeology. Also, will be provided a brief synthesis about the evolution of the national legal system for the protection of the archaeological heritage, and certainkey aspects which require a correlation with the relevant European legislation. The prespective
