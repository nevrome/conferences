Presentation Format: Oral
After Hendrick Hamel, a Dutch VOC sailor and his fellows left Joseon in 1666, it was not until the early 20th century that his story
was reintroduced to Korea. Ever since then, more than a dozen editions of Hamel’s journal were published, along with exhibitions
and museums that are dedicated to this historical figure. The local government of Gangjin county has set up a series of material
culture in memory of Hendrick Hamel. The material culture that is reproduced in modern Korean society, based on Korean’s understanding, reveals the need in contemporary society towards this particular past. His sudden popularity in Korean society also
reveals several intriguing questions. This article will test several contemporary archaeological methods along with ethnographic
methods, firstly to see how this 17th-century foreigner was memorized and reproduced in the Korean context. Secondly to see
why this historical person is so important to Korea. Thirdly to understand what Hamel and the related material culture means to
the locals of Gangjin county and Korean society in general.
