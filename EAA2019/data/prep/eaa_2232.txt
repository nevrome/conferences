Presentation Format: Oral
The archaeological site of Saruq al Hadid (Dubai, UAE) is a unique example of the beginnings of a nationâ€™s history. It has provided a
very important collection of archaeological objects that grows every day and that allows reconstructing the historical evolution
of a territory from the 1st Millennium BC. In turn, it contributes with several questions to the scientific community for the reliable
reconstruction of the activities that were developed in it and the events that led to its final. But, if this were not enough, Saruq al
Hadid represents a paradigm of understanding and management of the UAE Heritage at the most emerging moment in the country. A moment of change and evolution towards a diffusion of its Heritage and its culture with a high investment in the creation
of new museums and different formulas to exhibit its historical legacy. Through sites like the one presented here, Dubai wants
to show its History and bring it closer to the rest of the world; a complete future project that will culminate in the year 2020 with
the Universal Exhibition in the city.
