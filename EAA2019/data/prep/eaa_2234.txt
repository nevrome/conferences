Funerary taphonomy has been a growing field in recent years. There are many areas of this discipline where research is carried
out. In the last 25 years new methods have been developed and old has been refined. New progress brought new opportunities
for this study fields, nevertheless we are still challenged with the same problem. Archaeological excavation is a destructive
process and during which we only get one unique opportunity to make observation and documentation for future analysis and
interpretation. Once the excavation does most of the information, when not required, will be gone.
Where there are guidelines how to excavate and take care human remains. There are still no wide available rules, how to prepare
documentation that could be later used in the analysis and interpretation of human burials. Currently there is wide range digital
methods existing that can be employed in this process (Photogrammetry, GIS, drones, 3D scanning). There is growing trend to
use such methods and multiple case study show that they have great potential. However, there is still question what best practice should be. What can provide more information, be the most efficient and affordable technique to use in everyday archaeological research.
