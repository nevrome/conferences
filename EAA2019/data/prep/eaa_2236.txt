WRITING GRANTS FOR THE WENNER-GREN FOUNDATION
Organisers: Rutherford, Danilyn (Wenner-Gren Foundation)
Format: Workshop
The Wenner-Gren Foundation is a key supporter of anthropology worldwide. Danilyn Rutherford, the Foundation’s president, will
offer a workshop designed to help anthropologists from different countries and traditions of scholarship navigate the process
of getting a grant. She’ll describe the various funding opportunities Wenner-Gren offers for international graduate students,
faculty and institutions, say something about the review process, and offer helpful tips on how to write a winning proposal. She
will also share news about some initiatives Wenner-Gren is undertaking as part of its new strategic plan. There will be plenty of
time for questions.
