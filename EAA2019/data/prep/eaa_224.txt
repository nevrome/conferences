Presentation Format: Oral
Based on the archaeozoological (and archaeogenetic) record for the Northern and Southern Levant, this presentation will track
the evolution of animal domestication in the region, from its initiation at the onset of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period, ca. 10,500
years ago through to the establishment of fully fledged animal husbandry by the late Pottery Neolithic (ca. 6,500 BP). An integrated and up-to-date synthesis of current data for both regions for the four main domesticates – pig, sheep, goat and cattle, will be
given. We will highlight inter-specific and inter-regional differences/similarities in the domestication process, which is of special
interest given the tradition divide in timing and the cultural-historical sequences between the north and south. Issues to be
discussed include - methodologies used to assess domestic status, single versus multiple origins of domestic taxa, autochthonous domestication, diffusion events and the chronology and rate of the process. Reference will also be made to the concurrent
palaeoenvironmental, social and technological changes that have been documented in the archaeological record. Finally, we will
examine possible shortcomings and strengths in the data sets and critically examine current approaches and interpretations, as
an aid to future research in the region.
