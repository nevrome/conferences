The Early Holocene Nubian lithic industries are generally characterized by the debitage of small flint, chert, agate or quartz pebbles found in the alluvial terraces of the Nile or in wadi deposits. The products are essentially flakes, but bladelets are appreciated for the manufacture of numerous geometric microliths (lunates, triangles, trapezes) and backed pieces used to arm arrows.
Scrapers, perforators and notched pieces complete the common toolset.
The first proper lithic studies undertaken in Nubia were conducted by the Combined Prehistoric Expedition directed by F. Wendorf during the UNESCO salvage campaigns in the 1960s. These studies constitute the basis for defining the Nubian cultural
sequence stretching from the Late Pleistocene to the Middle Holocene. Since then, the work of D. Usai has permitted readjustments and a better understanding of the evolution of the lithic industries between Early to Middle Holocene. However lithic
studies are scarce in Nubia, especially in Upper Nubia. The discovery in the 2000s by M. Honegger of two Early Neolithic sites
dated to the first half of the 6th millennium BC in the Kerma region offer new data to apprehend the neolithisation of Nubia. The
analysis of the lithic industries - in progress in my PhD thesis - does not show a real rupture, but some new typological and technical components originating from the North seem to appear in conjunction with the first livestock.
