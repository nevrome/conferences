The site of El-Barga is located in Northern Sudan, 20 km to the south of the third cataract of the Nile, on the edge of the alluvial
plain. Between 2001 and 2014 excavations were undertaken firstly on the remains of an Epipalaeolithic habitation structure
dated from 7500 to 7300 cal BC. Then the fieldwork focuses on two cemeteries, one of Epipalaeolithic period (7800-6700 cal
BC) which revealed 45 inhumations and the other of Early Neolithic period (6000-5500 cal BC) with 108 individuals.
The contrast between the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic burials is striking and evokes those brought to light in the site of Gobero
in central Sahara. The individuals from the earlier burials have a robust morphology and are seldom buried with personal adornments. By contrast, the later ones are more gracile and are accompanied by offerings and personal effects, mostly made up of
tools and adornments. In addition, the comparative anthropological comparison of both assemblages underlines phenotypic
differences consistent with biological discontinuity in the human occupation of the area. Finally, the pottery presents either surfaces covered in impressed decorations of Sudanese Style or a burnished surface, whose diffusion from the north to the south
is more or less synchronous with the flow of Neolithic diffusion. This Early Neolithic cemetery, which is the oldest known for the
African Neolithic, announces at an early date the rites that were practiced in the Nubian cemeteries from the 5th millennium BC
onwards.
