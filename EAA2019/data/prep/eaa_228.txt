Located in Omdurman, approximately 8 km north of where the Blue and White Nile meet and 100 m from the current riverbed,
Khor Shambat is an exceptional place to study the Early and Middle Holocene in Central Sudan. The interdisciplinary research,
conducted as a part of the National Science Centre, Poland project (Grant no. 2015/17/D/HS3/01492 - A new perspective on prehistoric societies of the Early and Middle Holocene in Central Sudan in the view of interdisciplinary research studies), uncovered
the presence of stratificated remains of Mesolithic and Neolithic settlement, accompanied by ample archaeological material,
as well as radiocarbon dated burials from several chronological horizons. Use of the latest analytical methods to evaluate the
material collected over the last 3 years will allow us to significantly supplement current knowledge regarding the environmental
and cultural changes which took place here between 7000 and 3000 calBC, including the mechanisms of transformation from a
hunter-gatherers to famers.
