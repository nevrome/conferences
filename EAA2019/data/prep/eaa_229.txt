Located between South-west Asia (Syria) and North-east Africa (Egypt) that are two major centers of invention of pottery, the
Southern Levant is a key study region to raise various historical issues related to the widespread adoption of pottery. Yet, this
area of the Fertile Crescent has so far remained on the sidelines of research on the early ceramic productions because of the late
appearance of pottery (second half of the 7th millennium cal. BC). Although several theories have been put forward on the paces,
causes and processes for the widespread adoption of pottery in the southern Levant, the different assumptions remain highly
speculative because of the lack of consistent data on the first pottery productions.
This paper presents a critical review of current knowledge on the emergence of pottery in the southern Levant. We will first discuss chronological issues based on the thorough analysis of stratigraphic data, ceramic styles, and available C14 dates. Then,
we will discuss the reasons for the appearance of pottery in the southern Levant through a renewed approach of the utilitarian
and social functions of the earliest pottery in the region. Finally, we will discuss the processes for the widespread adoption of
pottery based on the available data regarding the manufacture of the first ceramic vessels.
