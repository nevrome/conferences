general scheme of the cultural development in the Western Desert. It is related to climatic fluctuations and settlement changes
observable in the sequence of wet and dry periods. Each wet period had its specificity in the scope of precipitations, fauna,
flora, etc. Changing conditions required cultural adaptations which had been reflected in ways of life and social organizations.
Can we, in light of the latest research, speak of a full Neolithic packet in each of the outlined principal phases in the region? In
our presentation, we wish to show the complexity of issues of Neolithic genesis and development in Western Desert, from the
Early Holocene settlement in the Desert, through the Holocene Optimum, until the end of prehistoric settlement in the area at
the end of 4.5 ca cal. BP.
