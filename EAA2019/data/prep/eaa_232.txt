VISIBILITY OF NEOLITHISATION WITHIN LITHIC COLLECTIONS FROM CENTRAL SUDAN

Presentation Format: Oral
Within central sudanese prehistory is strong traditionality within lithic toolkit. There are almost no ruptures and majority of types
of last hunter-gatherers are similar if no the same as are those of first agropastoralists. Most typical tool are segments/crescents/lunates for both periods/ lifestyles. There are slight changes within representation of different types of microliths. But
this evidence did not show any major shift of subsistence strategies.
Fortunatelly for the early Neolithic period there is one exception and this is presence of gouges (axe like bifacially shaped artfacts). Within lithic collection they are seen as a marker of Neolithic period. They last for quite short period (about 500 years
5500–5000 cal. BC). Especially for surface collections or sites with badly visible stratigraphy (which are quite abundant in this
region) within lithics gouges are almost only way how we are able to distinguish neolithic collections from slightly older hinter-gatherer asseomblages. Until today no detailed use wear analysis was done on them so we are not sure how they fit to the
puzzle of Neolithisation. According to our preliminary use wear observations they served for woodworking.
