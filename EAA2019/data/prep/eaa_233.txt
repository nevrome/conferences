The Kadruka site, on the right bank of the Nile south of the 3rd cataract, is crossed by the Wadi el-Khowi, a former branch or
course of the Nile that flowed about ten kilometers east of the current course. It was a major settlement pole for the populations
between fifth and fourth millennium BC.
Under thick layers of silt, a great number of funerary sites and settlements have been identified. While wind erosion has considerably abraded settlements, cemeteries located on small hills have proven more resilient and are preferred study structures to
understand societies.
The rich archaeological material extracted from the graves of the KDK1 funeral mound excavated by J. Reinold in the 1980s and
1990s is currently under study. The preservation of the material, despite decades of storage, lends itself to anthracological
studies, as well as to palynological, phytolithic and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) analyses. They concern objects, deposits
in vases or around the deceased, textiles, pillow contents. The same study was carried out on the burials of the KDK 23 funeral
mound, with the exception of anthracology.
The analysis of dental calculus collected from individuals buried in cemeteries 1, 18 and 23 is ongoing.
The presence of non-native taxa and cereals in the samples studied raises the problem of their origin, culture and process at
the end of the 5th millennium BC, the results obtained in settlements levels dated to the end of the fifth millennium not being
indicative of their presence.
