The establishment of mixed agropastoral, or pastoral with a strong element of agriculture, economies and their initial dispersals
across North-East Africa is still poorly known. This is especially true in the eastern Sahel (Sudan), despite this region long regarded as central to the origins of sorghum agriculture. Recently, studies of sorghum chaff imprints in ceramics has pushed back
domestication processes to between 3500 - 300 BC at KG23 near the Atbara river (eastern Sudan). This early sorghum is associated with hunting and fishing only. Later evidence for probably mixed cultivation of sorghum and pearl millet by ca. 1850 BC from
site K1 (Kassala) is associated with the herding of goats and sheep. This mixture of savanna pastoralism and sorghum remained
the foundation of the economy through the rise of the later Meroitic state (ca. 350 BC - AD 350). This raises questions about
how early pastoralism and sorghum cultivation were integrated and how quickly they spread within African savanna ecosystems.
The new archaeological fieldwork at Jebel Moya (ca. 240km south south-east of Khartoum) has produced robust empirical data
confirming integrated sorghum cultivation with cattle, sheep and goat pastoralism by the mid-third millennium BC. Lipid residue
analysis on sherds from 2000 years ago show animal fat and plant processing. A dating program has started on identified crop
and domesticated faunal remains, in addition to prior luminescence dates direct on pottery, which have been revised. These
dates also provide improved chronological sequences for the deposits excavated in the October 2017 fieldwork season, the
