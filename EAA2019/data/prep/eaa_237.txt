Among the most important aspects of social identity are sex and age-at-death. How these two pillars of social identity change
during the life course of individuals forms a focus of archaeological attempts to reconstruct the lived experience and social
structure of past human communities. With few exceptions, however, archaeological exploration of life course changes are often encumbered by a lack of integration of skeletal evidence, limited analytical approaches, and lack of a diachronic perspective.
The Neolithic of the Near East provides an ideal archaeological setting to test the links between growing population densities
and cultural complexity and alterations in the social perceptions of sex and age-at-death. Here, we update and expand previous
analyses of gender and the life course at Neolithic Çatalhöyük (Central Anatolia, 7100-5950 cal. B.C.) by means of an interdisciplinary approach based on palaeopathological, funerary archaeological, and material cultural evidence, a multivariate analytical
strategy, and a comparative perspective. The latter permits a contextualization of the observed patterns at Çatalhöyük against
the broader picture of the Neolithic Near East. The results provide a new angle from which to consider the structuring of lived
experience in this Neolithic community through time, at the same time providing a perspective on the social variability characterizing the Neolithic Near East
