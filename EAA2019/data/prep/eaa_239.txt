provide a unique resource for evaluating the long-term funerary practices and treatments in use at a single site.
Evidence for social distinction within the Neolithic population of Çatalhöyük, expressed through the social identity and cultural
value placed on individuals, is reflected in the funerary treatment of very young individuals. The differences between the funerary treatment of maternal-fetal mortalities and other adults also appear to reflect the social distinction and identity given by the
living to the unborn individual, and extended to its mother.
Here, I present findings on patterns in the funerary treatment of pre-childhood subadults from Neolithic Çatalhöyük and their
significance for interpreting broader trends in socio-cultural behaviours of the living population. Results of this study highlight
the potential of a fine-grained analysis of pre-childhood funerary treatment for untangling the roles of age, cultural tradition vs.
innovation, and diachronic social variability at Çatalhöyük and across the Neolithic Near East.
