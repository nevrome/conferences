This paper outlines an innovative research model that focuses on the human being by bringing together a set of methods for
studying human osteobiography. The holistic and interdisciplinary integration of lifecourse approaches, together with contextual archaeological and osteological data, as well as network analysis approaches extends the interpretative possibilities of
studies of human skeletal remains. The potential of this approach will be discussed by applying it to individuals excavated from
the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in Central Anatolia. The paper goes beyond the formula of perceiving the elements of the funeral
rite as a manifestation of the social position of the deceased in two aspects. Firstly, instead of focusing on social status, it attempts to reconstruct the entire life history of the deceased in multiple dimensions. Secondly, in the context of achieving these
goals, it goes beyond a formal analysis of funerary rites to propose a comprehensive and integrated method for examination of
archaeological manifestations of biographies.
