The large Neolithic tell site at Çatalhöyük holds an iconic status as an early mega-site settlement in the Konya Plain of central
Anatolia. Its large size of some 13 ha and considerable population density, without apparent social distinctions among its inhabitants, has made it an anomaly when other, albeit later sites, provide evidence of social differentiation. Because of its early
date, signs of social differentiation may be subtle and seem inconsequential when compared with those of later developments.
This study uses evidence of cranial trauma and anomalous or irregular burials, those found outside of the more commonplace
burial beneath house platforms, to suggest that individual social distinction was present at the site. Two adult males and an
adolescent were found in anomalous burial locations, but females sustained a greater number of cranial injuries than males,
and the patterning of injuries is different between the two sexes. It seems that both exclusion from platform burial and violence
were engendered and represent a form of social distinction. The site thus seems to provide a glimpse of early manifestations of
inegalitarian social relations that developed in a more fully blown manner in the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age.
