Presentation Format: Oral
This talk presents the results of use-wear analysis of chipped stone tools deliberately placed in burials found in the Neolithic
levels of the mega-site of Çatalhöyük (Central Anatolia). Funerary practices played an important role in the Çatalhöyük Neolithic
community. Chipped stone tools made both of obsidian and flint were sometime part of the grave goods and use-wear analysis
reveals a piece of their history and their role in these so meaningful situations.
Use-wear analysis can tell us if chipped stone tools participated actively as a medium used for making some of these practices,
or if they were deposited in a new or in used state in the burials after they had had a “long life” before their deposition in a grave.
Each of these possibilities opens different scenarios and help us to define variabilities or constancy of these practices at Çatalhöyük in its Neolithic phases. Moreover, a comparison between the use-wear observed on chipped stone tools found in funerary
and in “life” contexts will be presented with the aim to produce other suggestions for the understanding of the role of the chipped
stone tools in Çatalhöyük society.
