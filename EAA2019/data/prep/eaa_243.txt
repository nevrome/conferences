Excavations at the site of Neolithic Çatalhöyük (ca. 7100-6000 cal BC) over the past 25 years have revealed rich architectural
remains, along with diverse artefactual and ecofactual assemblages. The burial landscape at Çatalhöyük is characterized by intramural interments of mainly flexed primary inhumations, that were often furnished with objects of personal adornment such as
composite necklaces, bracelets and anklets made from beads of different forms and materials. Through a comparative analysis
of stone and shell grave inclusions, in particular beads, the aim of this paper is to unravel the microhistories of funerary practices
and to discuss practices of bodily adornment as evidenced through burial associations. Following a chaîne opératoire approach,
the analysis of stone and shell grave inclusions highlights similarities and differences and suggests that materials of distinct
origin and appearance (in terms of sources and physical properties), technological skill and temporalities were assembled during
funerary acts at Çatalhöyük. Particular emphasis is placed on the use-wear traces of stone and shell beads that indicate that
objects with varying biographical complexities (prolonged or short biographies) were often combined to form composite pieces
of adornment to decorate the dead. Practices such as this may have entailed the concerted actions of different individuals or
multiple social groups engaged in the construction of the individual and group identity. The correlation of the biography of grave
goods with the biography of the people they were buried with (in terms of age and gender) will enrich our understanding of funerary rites at Neolithic Çatalhöyük.
