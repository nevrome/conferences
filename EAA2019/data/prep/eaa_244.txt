Within Çatalhöyük, individuals are interred within the homes predominantly as primary single inhumations; however, multiple burials are also present and may have occurred over several burial events. Remains also show potential evidence for varying levels of
decomposition and defleshing. Further, there is head and limb removal as well as one decorated skull. These mortuary practices
are not entirely unique to Çatalhöyük. They are instead part of a larger pattern that can be observed within central Anatolia, which
is generally part of the Neolithic package that appears to accompany the adoption of plant and animal domestication.
In this presentation, the funerary practices of Çatalhöyük are compared and contrasted with those of surrounding sites both in
time and space. These sites include: Körtik Tepe, Çayönü, Boncuklu, Aşıklı Höyük, Çatalhöyük, Tepecik-Çiftlik, and Köşk Höyük.
Through this discussion, it is argued that mortuary practices in central Anatolia served as a means to reinforce social memory
and maintain social stability in the face of vast cultural change. These ritualized behaviors aided in the Neolithization of the region and largely disappeared at the end of the Neolithic as populations became increasingly socially stratified.
