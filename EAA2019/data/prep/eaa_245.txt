Recent bioarchaeological analyses at several Neolithic sites in Anatolia have revealed substantial inter- and intra-site variation
in the level of skeletal completeness, preservation, articulation and flexion among primary burials. Furthermore, organic remains
from burnt contexts at sites such as Çatalhöyük demonstrate that many bodies were tightly bound and wrapped using cordage,
matting, textile and animal hides. These observations are suggestive of a period of delay between death and final burial for certain individuals, likely as part of a multi-stage funerary rite, perhaps seasonal in nature. It appears that some bodies may have
been processed in such a way as to facilitate their temporary storage prior to burial. Potential treatments include exposure,
excarnation or desiccation of the corpse prior to binding and wrapping. In order to test this hypothesis, thin sections from human
cortical bone samples taken from three Anatolian Neolithic sites (Çatalhöyük, Boncuklu Höyük and Barcin Höyük) were analysed
using light microscopy and SEM imaging techniques in order to assess variation in bone microstructure preservation. As endogenous gut bacteria released into the body at the onset of putrefaction is believed to be responsible for a particular pattern
of microstructural alteration, the lack of such bioerosive features may indicate some form of postmortem treatment aimed at
reducing soft tissue body mass.
