Presentation Format: Oral
We explore the burial practices of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic site of Kharaysin (Zarqa, Jordan). The funerary evidence includes
primary and secondary burials, and skull caches dated from the Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (LPPNA) to the Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (LPPNB). Most burials have been recorded in the PPNB levels where most research has been done so far. We have found
primary burials with associated grave goods within a domestic building in the PPNA levels. Skull and bone retrieval are observed in
these burials, although burial disturbance prevents to consider if all the burials were affected. In the Middle PPNB levels, we have
found burials outside the domestic buildings and a funerary area with primary and secondary burials linked to complex rituals with
associated paraphernalia. We also observed burials with faunal remains that aimed to establish a symbolic relationship between
people and animals. Furthermore, a secondary burial with cremated bones was found in the LPPNB levels, which represents an
early example of this funerary practice in the Near East. We take into consideration all the available evidence to produce a picture
of the burial practices and their deviations across the time. Our preliminary results stress the importance of the mortuary behaviour to understand the evolution of the symbolism associated to the dead in the Neolithisation of the Near East.
