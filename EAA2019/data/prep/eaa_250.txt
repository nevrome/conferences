With the paradigm shift of the 1960s and 1970s there was a move in prehistoric archaeology away from Culture History models based on languages to other approaches taken from a range of other disciplines. It also saw, if not a total rejection of the
invasionist models usually associated with language change, at least a greater emphasis on other sorts of models for culture
exchange such as Peer Polity Interaction (Renfrew and Cherry). Personally I was mainly dealing with invasionist models used, for
instance, to identify the origin and expansion of the Celts (ethnicity. language, art, material culture) and also to understand the
British Iron Age for which I developed an ‘Overlapping Systems’ model for the adoption of coin using. More recently approaches
such as ‘Networks’ have come into favour. The recent work of geneticists have tended to ignore these different approaches and
they have reverted to invasionist models, which share common roots with eugenic interpretations and the racist approaches
found in the Third Reich. Part of the problem is a failure to understand the historiography of archaeological interpretations. I do
not accuse the geneticists of deliberately following these extremist approaches; none-the-less the vocabulary and concepts
used endanger the misuse of genetics for racist ends. In this paper I want to look at how the later models can be used to modify
the language and concepts of how genetic change takes place, and how it might relate to different aspects of cultural change
such as language and material culture.
