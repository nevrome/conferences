Ancient DNA has made it possible to identify a new class of human relationships: mating networks. I use the term ‘mating network’ for genetically linked populations that shared a distinctive group of genetic traits as determined by ancient DNA (aDNA)
analyzed across whole genomes, such that individuals from that chronological period and part of the world can confidently be
assigned to one mating network rather than another. In the Pontic-Caspian steppes five mating networks relevant to Yamnaya
origins can be defined through ancient DNA studies: North Caucasus piedmont, Volga-Don-Caucasus steppes, Dnieper steppes,
forest zone, and Danubian agriculturalist. One of these, in the Volga-Don-Caucasus steppes, makes the best candidate for the
genetic ancestors of the Yamnaya population of the late 4th/early 3rd millennium BC. Within this mating network we can now
tease apart family relationships within and between cemeteries on the Volga and observe the gradual co-evolution of the cultural traits that defined Yamnaya. The Yamnaya migrations of the 3rd millennium BC were preceded by shorter-distance movements
