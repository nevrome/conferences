Presentation Format: Oral
In this presentation I will present the results of my research into the Bell Beaker phenomenon from the perspective of a social
network of innovation. By combining both social network theory and innovation theory, I see regional developments in how communities around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC embrace the Bell Beaker phenomenon. Pottery frequencies and Bayesian
modelling show the varying pace and impact of the Bell Beaker adoption process: some communities adopt rapidly, whereas
others respond more slowly or completely reject the Bell Beaker phenomenon. The social mechanisms behind this process are
perceived through networks of information exchange, based on similarities in settlement material culture. Here we see that
there is a relationship between fast adopters versus slow adopters and the respective structures of their regional exchange
networks. In conclusion, I will present a model that combines these social networks of information exchange with the evidence
for mobility of persons and objects.
