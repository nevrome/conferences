Understanding past human mobility is key to understanding the complexity of prehistoric sites. During the 3rd millennium BC
large human aggregations appeared in southern Iberia. Different funerary patterns, including vast amounts of commingled human remains, create true palimpsests that make interpreting the archaeological record for this period challenging. Therefore,
specific sampling strategies based on the MNI should be defined according to the preservation of remains in order to investigate
site formation processes and mobility patterns.
This research incorporates multiple different methods that have been employed to investigate mobility patterns such as strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) and stable isotopes of oxygen (δ18O) in combination with AMS radiocarbon dating. In this paper,
we propose a specific sampling strategy that relies on bioarchaeological remains and includes human, faunal and environmental
samples. Such a strategy is crucial to develop an understanding of the local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr signature, and is also key
for contextualizing and clarifying site chronologies. For all of the sites analyzed, our results showed great inter-site variability,
revealing different mobility patterns and economic strategies which may correspond to regional adaptations.
