This paper aims to highlight the various ways in which art, including rock art, sculpture and portable art, can inform the study
of cultural mobility in late prehistoric Europe. Archaeologists studying hunter-gatherer societies across the globe, including
Paleolithic Europe, have long recognized ‘art’ forms as valuable sources for the study of cultural mobility, and have developed
advanced methodologies and theories in accordance to this. For late prehistoric Europe, however, during the last few decades,
prehistoric art has rarely been considered as a useful tool or valuable source of data for exploring mobility, being frequently
relegated to the realm of epiphenomena. Perhaps, this may have emerged as a reaction to Marija Gimbutas’ excessive, and methodologically weak, interpretations, or as the result of ideas linking Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age communities with stability,
territoriality, boundedness and, at times, isolation. But nowadays it is recognized that late prehistoric communities in Europe
could be highly connected, fluid and/or mobile, while being linked to tradition and place. In this context, the rich late prehistoric
rock art, sculptural, and portable art traditions found in Europe have much to offer for the investigation of the mobility of people,
things and ideas, especially when examined within new theoretical frameworks, with new methodologies, and in combination
with other lines of evidence. I will present various case studies to illustrate this.
