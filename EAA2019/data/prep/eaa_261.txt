A comprehensive provenance study of nearly 120 Bronze Age swords, comprising lead isotope and trace elemental data for
swords from Scandinavia, Germany and Italy dated between 1600 and 1100 BC, will be presented. European Bronze Age swords
were items with high functional and symbolic value and therefore a very interesting case for approaching the question of metal
trade in Bronze Age Europe. Often, a correspondence between metal supplies and artefact type/style has previously been assumed. The current study shows, on the contrary, that metal supply and sword brands were mostly unrelated. The chronology
and geography of the deposited swords indicate that the different regions relied on different metal trade routes, and that these
changed during the course of the Bronze Age. The largest variation in metal supply is seen during 1600–1500 BC, when copper
ores in Wales, Austria as well as Slovakia constituted the major copper sources for the swords, however, unevenly distributed
among the regions. Around 1500 BC, copper mines in the Italian Alps became the main supplier for the Scandinavian and Italian
swords while swords from Germany were foremost based on copper from Slovakia and Austria. However, during 1300–1100 BC
the sources in the Italian Alps became the dominant supplier of copper for the swords in all regions accounted for here. There
seem also to be a possibility that copper from southern Iberia makes its appearance among a few of the Scandinavian swords
during this phase. Potential trade routes and trade networks will also be discussed in the light of the shifting sources of copper
to Scandinavia.
