The end of the Pre-Roman and the beginning of the Roman Period is a transformative phase in the Finnish Iron Age as new burial
traditions and material wealth appears in the coastal region of Finland. These have been interpreted partially as close connections across the Baltic Sea, but also as a sign of the arrival of migrant groups from Scandinavia and Estonia. The southern connection is particularly interesting, because Estonian tarand cemeteries have been found sporadically from a coastal region of
Finland, which extends from the Gulf of Finland to the northernmost part of the Bothnian Bay.
In previous studies the tarand tradition has been straightforwardly connected to a migration from Estonia and relatively little
attention has been placed on the relations between the migrants and the local population living in these areas. This question
is particularly interesting, because in many sites the tarand burials appear alongside other burial forms. Weapons also form a
dominant group among the grave goods, which is uncommon in Estonia.
Uncremated bones from the Iron Age have rarely preserved in Finland, but tarand cemeteries form an exception to this rule and
remains of dentition and bones have been found from a number of sites. By utilizing aDNA and stable isotope analyses it is possible to bring new light on the issue of the origin of the migrants, the scale of the migration and how the relations between the local
population and the migrant groups developed over the course of the Roman Period.
