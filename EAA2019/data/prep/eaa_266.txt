The investigation of domestic animal management is crucial for understanding the development of mountain societies and the
evolution of the mountain landscapes. Pastoral activities, notably, have contributed to the development of landscapes since the
Neolithic. During the last decades, the use of isotope analyses, especially strontium, oxygen and carbon isotopes, have been
widely exploited by the bioarchaeological community in order to assess past transhumant-pastoral activities. However, only
a few studies have investigated this issue on modern livestock under controlled conditions. In this paper, we will consider the
tracking of short-distance vertical mobility and husbandry practices on modern transhumant sheep in the North-western Alps
via a multiple isotopic approach (87Sr/86Sr, δ18O and δ13C). The isotopic study includes enamel from several teeth and considers the plants consumed by animals from lowland and high-altitude grazing areas. The results allow us to discuss methodological
challenges, the potential and limitations of using isotopic tools on this research target.
