The reconstruction of livestock practices in high mountain areas is important for understanding the integration of these spaces
into the economy of ancient societies. However, it is often challenging to characterize this activity due to the poor preservation of archaeological remains in these extreme and sensitive environments. Over the last decade, multidisciplinary landscape
archaeology combining archaeological and palaeoenvironmental analyses have allowed documenting both the long-term occupation and landscape impact of ancient pastoral societies in the eastern Pyrenees. However, many open questions on highland
husbandry remain yet open such as the animal and/or by-products exploited. To bypass these limitations, here we propose to
apply a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses not only Archaeozoological, Anthracological and Palynological studies, but
also lake sediment DNA analyses into the study of livestock practices in the Madriu valley (eastern Pyrenees). The ultimate
interrelation of all these data and their contextualization with the archaeological livestock structures documented in the area,
will allow us to better evaluate and characterise the importance and fluctuations throughout history of this economic activity.
