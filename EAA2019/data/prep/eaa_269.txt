Located at an elevation of over 3000 feet, the Swat Valley is nestled between the Hindukush mountain range. The region has
long been recognised as a frontier, buffering interactions between South and Central Asia. Owing to its geographical location,
the Swat Valley has gained significance as a crossroads, showing archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological and human evidence of
movements in the past. The first evidence of agriculture of Southwest Asian domesticates dates to at least the 4th millennium
BCE, while South Asian domesticates are adopted from the 1st millennium BCE. In other words, the Swat Valley presents itself
as a case study not only as a palimpsest of high altitude societies, but also as a frontier of interaction between the cultural phenomena of South and Central Asia. Moreover, the geographical and ecological features distinguish the region as a refuge in an
otherwise hostile, mountainous environment. Here we present stable isotope data from faunal and human remains from various
sites in the Swat Valley spanning a millennia. Our data provide multi-scalar, multi-proxy, cross-temporal insights into resilience in
the region and shed light on how these mountain societies developed through time in the face of inter-cultural influx.
