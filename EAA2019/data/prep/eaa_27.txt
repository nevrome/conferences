Monumental medieval tombstones from western Balkans, called stećci, are mostly unknown to the international archaeological
public. Their vast numbers voice the widespread funerary custom of the period between 12th and 16th century when tombstones marked the graves in the countries of modern Montenegro, Croatia, Serbia, but mainly in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the
latter has more than 60 000 of these monuments dispersed around the countryside.
Stećci characterise a specific funerary phenomenon and represent a unique interdigitation of traditions, religions, artistic and
aesthetic expressions, as well as languages. These monuments embody centuries of Bosnian tolerance, which evolved from
long-lasting cohabitation of local, diverse ethnicities and religions. Stećci have an exciting potential to tackle questions around
death and burial, the dynamics of political complexities and a continually important topic of religion and society.
As Bosnia is a predominantly rural country, these challenges will expose the ways of life in both, deserted villages and modern
villages, hamlets, and small towns originating in the middle ages. This paper tackles the development of medieval rural communities in Bosnia, the comparison between still-inhabited and permanently deserted settlements, and the religious conversions
and adaptation in a multi-religious region.
