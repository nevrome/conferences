Even if, archaeology and environmental archaeology their capacity to reconstruct how rural areas, and in particular mountains,
were managed from prehistory until the present, excluding the well-studied British “enclosure” process, the jurisdictional dimension of environmental resources management practices, which was a key dimension at least until the end of the Old Regime, is
one of the less considered in the archaeology of recent periods. The investigation of the double nature of resource management
practices as ‘technical facts’ and ‘legal facts’ is central for deciphering changes in the management of mountain areas, above
all during these last centuries, when central authorities promoted deep changes in the environmental resources management
practices, forbidding multiple uses and changing the rules of the access rights to commons and of the co-sharing of resources.
However, a few archaeological attempts have been made to study the consequences of Capitalism rural Southern Europe. The
paper aims to focus on the study of practices and their changes in the last three centuries, with the aim to decipher what the
process of marginalisation of mountain areas was and is. Thanks to archaeobotanical (pollen, NPP’s, phytoliths, charcoal) and
geochemical analyses of soils and sediments, present vegetation observation and artifacts survey, archaeology can shed light
on: - phenomena that can be lost in generalisations made from written sources; - the local environmental knowledge which sustained the management of environmental resources, and which still need to be identified; - in addition, studying and collaborating with present societies, archaeology can bring to light criticisms of the current protections and policies applied to mountain
areas, demonstrating the fragility of their heritage and the extent to which its conservation depends upon the hidden social and
historical dimensions of environmental resource management.
