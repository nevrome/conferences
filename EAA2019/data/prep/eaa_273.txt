WORKING WITH CERAMICS IN THE 21ST CENTURY
Theme: Archaeological heritage and museum management: future chances, future risks
Organisers: Hall, Derek (Stirling University) - Witte, Frauke (Museum SÃ¸nderjylland) - Regner, Elisabet (National Historical Museums Stockholm)
Format: Regular session
The study of ceramics has the ability to reconstruct a staple part of everyday life across many periods but is it being properly resourced? Across Europe the problems of storage and display of such material are becoming greater largely due to the pressures
of funding and changes in focus. Are we now at a point where specialist decisions need to be made on site as to what should be
kept and what should be discarded? If so on what basis should such choices be made? How accessible are existing collections
of pottery for research and more to the point is adequate training in place to ensure that such research can take place both now
and in the future? This session will consider these issues from the point of view of both excavated assemblages of pottery and
existing curated collections. Consideration will also be given to the need for common standards in both the naming of fabrics and
their accessibility in museum collections. Scientific analysis (both chemical and petrological) is now becoming more widely used
in the study of ceramic materials and thought needs to be given as to how best to share the results and data so that everyone
working in the field can use it. The session organisers would like to invite contributions from across Europe covering all periods
of ceramic research and display.
