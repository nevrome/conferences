yet. Ceramics in this case are an unique and the most informative materials. For investigations the samples of pottery from the
archaeological sites of the Dniester basin (Glinjeni, Saharna, Soldaneshti, Selishte), of the Dnieper basin (Subbotiv, Zhabotin), of
the Southern Bug basin (Nemirov, Dikyi Sad) and from burials situated on this territory as well the samples of mineral raw materials were collected. The technological features and composition of ceramics, white inlay and raw materials were studied in thin
sections, by XRF-WD method, by SEM-EDS analysis. The m-CT method was used for porosity calculation and 3D visualization of
voids inside of ceramic texture.
