We define the special cycle of preliminary works for this (based on work experience with ceramics of Russian medieval monuments). It is primary statistical processing of ceramics (by method of V. Koval) and analysis of their technological and morphological features, type of ornamental designs; grouping ceramics in accordance with different cultural traditions; detection of fragments from the same vessels, gluing and scientific reconstruction of entire forms; drawing and photography of unique vessel
forms and their cross-sections; composing of generalizing tables with information about the whole variety of ceramics groups in
quantitative and percentage ways, the distinctive features each of the groups and their correlation in different complexes from
the settlement; dating of ceramics complexes; text description of all the ceramics materials’ features.
After such processing the amount of ceramics decreases in 4 times. The structure of the identified complexes has to be preserved in the museum collections. So, an exact model of the total amount ceramics materials from the excavation is formed.
Together with the information received by the researcher, it is already a complete archaeological source. This model guarantees
the verifiability of this data for other scientists.
This optimization allows to transfer collections to the museum, despite the objective lack of storage space. The museum staff
has to do only the specific museum restoration, storage and display of materials. The most attractive vessels are usually shown.
So archaeological ceramics is used as a full-fledged source, and for the promotion of the archaeological heritage.”
