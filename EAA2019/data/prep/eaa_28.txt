Presentation Format: Oral
The Islamic Baydha Project focuses on archaeological investigations of an Islamic-period village in the area of Bayda, Petra region. The site, which includes village habitations organised in several clusters, a church, and two mosques, has been in use from
at least the Nabataean to the Ottoman periods. This continuity of occupation originates from the fortunate geological and climatic conditions which have always made this area one of the most favoured of the Petra region for agricultural activities.
Some of the principal aims of the Islamic Baydha Project are to investigate the range and development through time of the
forms and dynamics of settlement in the Petra region during the whole Islamic period and to explore the important relationship
between the Petra valley, where settlement continued without major gaps, and its hinterland
The Islamic Baydha Project is a project of archaeological research, conservation, training and community engagement. These
components are all well connected, especially because the local community, which lives nearby and has abandoned the village
only in the recent past, is deeply involved with the presence of the site.
Involvement of the local community has revealed to be a key element supporting research progress, cultural heritage protection,
interest in connecting with the recent past and in sharing ideas for the future of the site.
