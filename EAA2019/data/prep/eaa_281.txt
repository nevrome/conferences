Archaeological excavations in Ribe, Jutland, began in the 1950’s and have over the years created a collection of more than half a
million artefacts of which ceramics make up c. 400.000 sherds.
The finds cover the time span from c. AD 700 until present day, but especially the finds from the first 500 years of the town’s history are of international importance. During this time span Ribe was initially an important North Sea emporium (C. 700-1050) and
later a likewise important High Medieval trading town (c. 1050-1250). During this half millennium, Ribe served as a trading hub
connecting Scandinavia with Northern Europe and connecting international merchants with agricultural products from Denmark.
This wide array of trading contacts brought huge amounts of imported pottery into Ribe in the form of Badorf-, Tating- and Reliefbandamphor-wares followed later by Pingsdorf-, Paffrath-, Andenne-, Rouen- and Flemish-type wares and a bit of English pottery
as well. In some periods, the imports make up to 25% of the pottery while the rest is greywares including small numbers of Muschelgrus-ware (Shelly-ware) and Slavonic-type pottery.
In 2006, we began a full retrospective digitization of the collections and as the information in the database grew, we moved the
finds to our new purpose-built storage.
The paper presents the thoughts, results and modus operandi behind this big project, executed by a local, small to medium-sized
Danish Museum with very little external funding. And claims, that it is possible, worthwhile and meaningful to collect pottery in
huge numbers – at least from stratigraphic excavations in urban layers.
