THE EHLERS COLLECTION. NORTHERN EUROPE’S LARGEST COLLECTION OF LOCALLY PRODUCED
EARTHENWARE - POSSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES
Author(s): Witte, Frauke (Museum Sønderjylland)
Presentation Format: Oral
The collection was established by Louis Ehlers (1916-1998) at the beginning of the 1930’s with the purpose of documenting the
history of Danish potters and preserving their earthenware for future generations. The collection covers a period from the Middle
Ages until the 1940’s, representing every region of Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany).
The collection includes several thousand artefacts. Most of these are intact, exhibited, and available for scholars. The collection
includes pots, dishes, plates, as well as toys, piggy banks, stove tiles and much more. The collection displays, especially, the
dispersal of types of decorations in the different regions, with emphasis on pottery from the 16th to the middle of the 18th
century. Opposite to archaeological finds, here is opportunity to see the objects as a whole. However, part of the collections
oldest artefacts are finds with unknown archaeological contexts. As for the younger artefacts, the provenance and dating is
often uncertain, and especially the provenance registered as the location where the artefact was obtained, instead of the use
or production location. The lecture will give an introduction to the collection, and attempt to outline what it can be used for, and
where its limitations lie.
