EARLY MODERN CERAMICS IN GOTHENBURG - DEALING WITH LARGE UNPUBLISHED ASSEMBLAGES
Author(s): Wennberg, Tom (Museum of Gothenburg)
Presentation Format: Oral
The last century of archaeology in Gothenburg have resulted in extensive archaeological assemblages now being stored by the
Museum of Gothenburg. The first half of this period created relatively small manageable materials. During the 70â€™s new legislation in Sweden gave way of a new more methodological archaeology. This new legislation implied that every anthropogenic
remains older than 100 years would be protected by law. The developer was financial responsible for the archaeological costs (or
could choose to not develop). The legislation has since then changed, and protection are now fixed to not later than 1850 , with
some exceptions of protected remains of later age.
These large assemblages have piled up in the museum store, though to a larger degree published in conceptual excavations
reports, seldom analysed at any deeper level. This paper will present and discuss an ongoing project of analysing and publishing
an extensive archaeological ceramic material collected for over a century at the Museum of Gothenburg. The methods that will
be discussed are primarily from a collection and archival point of view. The importance of knowledge-based networks in the new
era of social media in combination with the importance of meeting face to face will be stressed. The experiences from the conference Gothenburg Ceramics 2019 will be used as a current example.
