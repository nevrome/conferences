only in the number of historical sites excavated but the excavations themselves are now being done mainly by the independent
companies. This leaves the National Museum and couple of other archaeological collections the curators of growing collections
selected by others.
This paper will shed light on work with pottery within the Finnish system as a field archaeologist. A large-scale urban excavation
in Turku Market Square in Southwestern Finland in 2018 provides a main case study for the theme. Other projects by the same
company, Muuritutkimus Oy, gives a wider perspective for the last decade.
What is the role for an independent company and its archaeologists as the first hand collector of the pottery (excavations)
and cataloguing the finds using the museumsâ€™ guidelines (databases, if there are any). Who handles the pottery during post
excavation processes and with what kind of an education? Where to draw the line between the basic cataloguing as part of the
excavation report and more detailed pottery studies?
The time span of historical archaeology has widened from few medieval centuries to early modern -modern periods and occasionally very recent times. Pottery that was discarded as too modern few decades ago is now being collected. Is there any way, or is
there any need, to master all the material when new types emerge all the time?
