With a long-term history and a strategical geographical position, the island of Crete in Greece constitutes a reference point.
While chronological range along with the quantity of archaeological data of the island are enormous, they are at the same time
of great importance. The place’s history is exhibited throughout museums as well as it is projected on various archaeological
sites. In the museums which are placed in several parts but mainly in the capitals of Crete’s four prefectures, ceramic vessels
characterize a large amount of the existing curated collections. Indisputably, through each period’s wealth of findings, it should
be reflected the timelessness of Cretan civilization. At the same time though, all this information should and could be available
for archaeologists in order to promote and enrich research.
However, concern occurs related to medieval history of Crete and more specifically considering how it is represented and projected through material culture as well as how fieldworkers have any necessary access to this. The questions that come up are
many; is it able for Cretan medieval pottery findings to be exhibited to one or two showcases of a museum? Is this enough? Were
there any related excavations that could provide additional findings of that era? If so, where are those? Are they that similar to
the ones already presented, explaining the main reason of concealment? Or is this earthenware just hidden somewhere? Underground maybe waiting for its discovery or in some storage room anticipating its study?
Inquiries as the above occur and seek answers. Through personal experiences which emerged during research for PhD thesis
involving medieval pottery in Crete, light upon this matter will be shed, along with certain ideas for any modified models of medieval ceramics on display.
