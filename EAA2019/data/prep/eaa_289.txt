Ceramics are the most abundant type of material recovered in medieval and post medieval archaeological contexts in Portugal.
Working with such objects is a high demanding task especially due to the amounts. An average urban excavation deals with
thousands of sherds of objects produced either in Portugal or imported. Although archaeologists in Portugal are trained to deal
with ceramics that training is not enough to deal with all the information we can retrieve from these artefacts. In this sense and
in spite of archaeological reports have a general approach to ceramics this is not enough to actually conclude much about it. In
this sense most of the research work surrounding ceramics is made by Master and PhD students. Is it easy to access collections,
where and how are these stored, what techniques are usually used? These will be some of the questions.
This paper aims to discuss what kind of research is made in Portugal concerning medieval and post-medieval archaeological
ceramics and all the process involved in ceramic research. What do archaeologists privilege when they approach ceramic collections and where is this research presented and published.
