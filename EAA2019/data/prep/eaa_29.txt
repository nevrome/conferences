The present paper intends to highlight the early Medieval Culture in a broad perspective in the coastal plain of West Bengal which
has produced innumerable edifices of early medieval settlements in the form of potteries, sculptures, architectural pieces, exposed brick structures, copper plates and objects used in day to day life. The date range of the materials is broadly from 8th /
9th century CE to 12th/ 13th century CE. This phase has been considered as the Early Medieval period in Eastern India. All these
materials are discovered from currently inhabited village sites of Deltaic region of the State of West Bengal, an integral part of
Eastern India. The coastline of Bengal forms the world’s largest deltaic region. Geographical situation is very significant for the
development of early medieval habitations in this region. An intricate survey of the different villages in this region carried out for
more than three decades and a half has led to the discovery of a large number of early historic and early medieval secular settlements. Some of the Early medieval sites such as Dadpur, Dakshin Gobindapur, Baishata, Mandirtala, Kankandighi and others in
South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal would be highlighted in this study.
