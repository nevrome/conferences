Material culture is a part of the process to study any social context. In this direction, traditionally, ceramics represent an important marker to understand cultural, ideological and ritual phenomena of ancient societies. But, above all, the ceramic evidences
are a reflection of all economic aspects related to ancient settlements. In fact, the study of pottery means to reflect on broader
issues concerning processes of productions and provenance: are they produced on site or are they bought on a wider commercial
network?
In the latest excavations, in the early medieval village of Miranduolo (eighth century), we found a lots of furnace waste, a clear
evidence of pottery productions on site. These evidences allows to investigate on an unknown aspect of the settlement, concerning the production and the relationship between local and imported potteries. In this direction, archaeometric results are
an essential contribution to this research; in addition to expanding the knowledge on the early medieval furnaces of Tuscany,
archaeometric methodologies allow us to recognize the different phases of production, starting from the choice and the processing of raw materials up to the cooking systems. This methodology, applied on samples of furnace waste, is essential to
understand the role and type of pots produced at Miranduolo. In other words, were they independent artisans or linked to the elite
figures recognized in the community? Were they itinerant or local workers? Otherwise, could it only be a domestic production?
With this paper, I will try to answer these questions by looking the evidences for the purpose to define a socio-economic model
for the eighth century village.
