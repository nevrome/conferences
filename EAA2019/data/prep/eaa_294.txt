The study include microscopic analysis of pottery of the Final Neolithic Corded Ware culture communities from south-eastern
Poland. Vessels were found in richly equipped niche graves of individuals of different sex and age. Petrographic study of the
pottery was focused on differences and similarities in clay preparing depending on kind of vessel and its decoration motives. The
thin section of ceramic samples was analysed determining mineral composition and technology of pottery paste used in vessel
production. The research encompassed the content of detrital material, grain size and rounding, and selection aspects. The two
main type of vessels e.g. amphora and beaker was subjected to analysis. The aim of these examinations was to set the rate of
utilisation the local raw materials to the production of vessels. Conducted analyses also verified if similarly decorated vessels
were locally manufactured or were traded in the interregional network.
The project is currently being implemented (National Science Centre, Poland, NCN 2015/19/B/HS3/02149).
