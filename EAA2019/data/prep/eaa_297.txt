To disseminate new knowledge and foster the young peopleâ€™s interest in the archeological collection, a series of video-lessons
and storytelling sessions will be held via social network and dedicated website.
The project hopes to face the challenge to provide the visitor a satisfying experience in spite of relying on limited resources by
using free-license software and staff skilled in the digital humanities field.
