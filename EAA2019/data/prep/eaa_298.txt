Format: Regular session
The EAA’s Committee on Professional Associations in Archaeology held a very successful session in Barcelona and two threads
from that discussion will be taken forward in Bern in 2018, in a session for which we invite papers. Professionalism of archaeologists and associations of archaeological professionals are two different concepts. The EAA maintains that all archaeologists
should have access to membership in a professional association, but all archaeologists will belong to archaeological organisations that are not primarily ‘professional’ in nature or in activity. We must recognise that in this diversity there can be strength.
But to make use of the strength in that diversity we need to know:
•
Who we are – we need to find the archaeological organisations of Europe, and
•
What we all do, so that we do not unnecessarily compete amongst ourselves or confuse other parts of civil society by
the way we speak and the messages we send out.
This session will contain papers addressing both strands of who we are and how we can and should clarify our roles and messages so as to more effectively influence civil society and governments at international, national and local levels.
