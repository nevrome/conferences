Presentation Format: Oral
The EAA’s Committee on Professional Associations in Archaeology held a very successful session in Barcelona and two threads
from that discussion will be taken forward in Bern in 2018, in a session for which we invite papers. Professionalism of archaeologists and associations of archaeological professionals are two different concepts. The EAA maintains that all archaeologists
should have access to membership in a professional association, but all archaeologists will belong to archaeological organisations that are not primarily ‘professional’ in nature or in activity. We must recognise that in this diversity there can be strength.
But to make use of the strength in that diversity we need to know:
•
a) Who we are – we need to find the archaeological organisations of Europe, and
•
b) What we all do, so that we do not unnecessarily compete amongst ourselves or confuse other parts of civil society
by the way we speak and the messages we send out.
By self-organisation we contend that archaeologists can exert better influence on governments and governmental agencies in
order to improve and develop the value of heritage work to the public and improve the working conditions and careers of practitioner.”
