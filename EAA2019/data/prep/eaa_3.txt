BASQUE HIGH MATTERS. MATERIALIZATION PROCESSES IN BASQUE HILLS AND BOREAL AREAS
Author(s): Escribano-Ruiz, Sergio (University of the Basque Country)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Basque Country is considered a mountainous area, with jagged hills scattered along an east-west axis ending in the Pyrenees. This orography has been the scenario where the Basques did settle and where uncountable materialization processes
occurred. In addition Basques are known for their Modern Age fisheries in a subpolar area as the Gulf of St Lawrence. In this
presentation we will consider how material culture was created and used by Basques and how they depended on materiality to
face their changing life conditions both in the hills of their homeland and in that specific colonial environment. On the one hand,
the focus will be upon a specific type of rural building that is characteristic of Basque hills settlement, and that could not be
understood without accounting for globalization. On the other hand, the material culture associated to Basques in Canada will
be compared to that used in their homeland, to see if the changing climatic conditions implied a different set of materials. One
resulting conclusion might be that even apparently marginal, those hills and subpolar areas were in the epicentre of a progressive
globalism and capitalism in which Europe was immersed.
