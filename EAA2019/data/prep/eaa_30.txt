THE BEGINNINGS OF SUZDAL VILLAGES

Presentation Format: Oral
Suzdal Opolie, the central part of the Northeastern Rus, was characterized by poor urbanization as well as high density of population in the 10-13 centuries.
The high density is proved, in the first place, by the data from “deserted rural settlements”. Their cultural layer has regularly been
disturbed by ploughing. In the same time, Opolie still has villages that are known from narrative sources of the 15 century (or earlier) as large settlement complexes. Topographically they lie close to the central sites of the 10-12 centuries; part of them had
decayed till the end of the period embraced by the research. It must be admitted that in the local circumstances the research of
inhabited medieval rural settlements faces challenges. The most promising spots (areas near churches, red lines of the streets)
are often covered with grass or built up. Moreover, even the sectors of modern vegetable gardens have their cultural layers just
partly disturbed. That’s why the results of the gathering of picked-up items are not as definite for them as they could be for the
“deserted sites” that have been ploughed-up for centuries, with their cultural layers disturbed through and through.
One of our aims is to fix the time when the settlement system marked by the existing villages emerged, as well as to see its
connection with the previous one. We are also trying to find the way of comparison between the results of total gathering of the
picked-up items from the deserted sites and test-pitting of historical villages.
