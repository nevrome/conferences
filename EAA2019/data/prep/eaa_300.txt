The Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland (IAI) is the representative all-island organisation for professional archaeologists working in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The primary objectives of the IAI include promoting contact, collaboration and cooperation
between professional archaeologists and the organisations they belong to and improving archaeological standards throughout
the island of Ireland.
Within the last three years, the IAI has achieved its core objectives by implementing a Three-Year Strategic Plan as approved by
its members; signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists; maintained communication with Ireland’s National Monument Service; partnered with Ireland’s Heritage Council for a conference entitled, “Dig: the value
of archaeology for society and the economy”; and taken an active role in the public consultation for ”Heritage Ireland 2030”, a
new national heritage plan launched by Ireland’s Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.
Additionally, the 2019 IAI Annual Conference, “Now and Again: Current and Recurring Issues Facing Irish Archaeologists” primarily
focused on the archaeological profession by way of two sessions. In Session 1, national stakeholders and IAI members presented their perspectives on the current state of the profession and future challenges. These papers were used as starting points
