TRADITIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
Author(s): Thiermann, Ellen - Reitmaier, Thomas (Archäologie Schweiz)
Presentation Format: Oral
In this paper, the authors aim to present Archäologie Schweiz – Archéologie Suisse – Archeologia Svizzera to an international audience in order to discuss common goals and challenges and to foster collaboration with other European associations. Founded
in 1907 as a learned «Swiss Society of Prehistory» promoting and sustaining archaeological research and conservation, Archäologie Schweiz is still the only national archaeological association in Switzerland covering all epochs and functioning also as an
umbrella organisation with approximately 2000 members in all Swiss language areas.
Bringing together laypersons interested in archaeology and the grand majority of professional archaeologists, this historically
grown unity is a rare feature in Europe bearing challenges regarding the variety of interests of its members, but also constituting
its strength in terms of public engagement. The paper will address the peculiarities of Switzerland’s archaeological heritage and
its organisation of archaeological research and conservation as basic parameters. Archäologie Schweiz’ continuing work in the
field of publications, events, networking and political work will be presented, followed by a discussion of its current challenges
and visions for the future. As topics like the digital turn in documentation, open access-publications, professional standards,
community building and political lobbying are on the agenda of most archaeological associations, we would like to encourage the
exchange of experiences and ideas with other session participants.
