Presentation Format: Oral
The Swiss Association of Classical Archaeologists (SACA) was founded in 1992 and is composed both of professional archaeologists working in the field of Mediterranean archaeology in Switzerland and abroad, as well as of university students. One of the
organisationâ€™s purposes is to represent the interests of the archaeology of past cultures in the Mediterranean region to the authorities and the wider public. As such, the SACA was consulted during the drafting of the Swiss Federal Act on the International
Transfer of Cultural Property (LTBC) which was passed in 2005.
