Furthermore, the SACA strives to promote networking among scholars working in the field of Mediterranean archaeology. Once
a year a roundtable on a specific topic is organised to which researchers are invited to present and discuss the results of their
studies. The SACA also maintains close ties to professionals from other archaeological and historical sub-disciplines through
its memberships in the associations of the National Information Centre on Cultural Heritage (NIKE) and the Swiss Archaeology
Network (NAS).
Finally, the organisation also acts as an information platform through itâ€™s website (www.saka-asac.ch) and yearly journal (Bulletin
SAKA-ASAC) and has (co-)published scientific publications.
The aim of this paper is to present the history and the current status of the organisation to the international scientific community and to discuss some of its future goals.
