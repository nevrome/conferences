ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROFESSIONALISM AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS

The abstract for this session rightly notes that the professionalism of archaeologists and associations of archaeological professionals are two different things. This paper examines the relationship between the two with specific reference to the UK. The
development of the ‘polluter pays’ model in the UK saw the emergence of a large ‘private-sector archaeology’ which ultimately
developed the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) as a means of self-regulation. However this process created a distinction between ‘professional’ and ‘non-professional’ archaeologists, and to some extent tension and confusion too. Ironically
CIfA’s early 1980s origins lay in an initiative by the Council for British Archaeology (CBA), which had itself been established to
provide a forum and focus for a range of largely non-professional archaeological associations. Whilst some of these associations
were national (or even international) in scope with a wide membership base of professional, academic and amateur archaeologists, many were much more regional or even local in focus and dominated by non-professionals. This paper looks at the ways
in which the myriad of archaeological associations relate both to each other and to the professional association. Some ways in
which fruitful partnerships could be delivered in the future are explored.
