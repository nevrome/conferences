MOTHERHOOD IN (PRE-)HISTORY FROM A COMBINED BIO-ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes
Organisers: Rebay-Salisbury, Katharina (Austrian Academ of Sciences) - Stefanović, Sofija (Biosense Institute, University of

Format: Regular session
In recent years, an ‘archaeology of motherhood’ has started to emerge, which investigates one of the most profound changes
of identity women experience: the transition to motherhood. Motherhood includes a range of cultural choices and practices in
addition to the biological framework of sexual reproduction, which are subject to change.
For prehistoric Europe, little is known at what age women became mothers, how many children they had, how siblings were
spaced and how families were composed. It is equally unclear if women were selected for reproduction, how the social status of
women changed as they became mothers, and which rites and rituals were involved that might leave traces in the archaeological record. Objects related to pregnancy, birth and early childrearing are only slowly being identified, as interest in researching
motherhood intensifies.
How motherhood was conceptualized and embedded in societies, however, has profound consequences on demography, population structure and even DNA composition. This session invites papers that advance our understanding of motherhood from
theoretical, osteological, bio-archaeological, demographic, isotopic and genetic perspectives. The aim is to discuss motherhood
in the light of the latest results emerging from aDNA and isotope studies across Europe and to firmly establish motherhood as a
research topic in archaeology.
