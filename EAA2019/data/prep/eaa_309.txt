microscopic level in the tooth cementum may be of fundamental importance for further studies of fertility and motherhood. Certain life-events have been shown to interfere with the deposition of tooth cementum, among which pregnancy was mentioned.
This important fact was however only referred to in a limited number of publications. In order to gain more specific knowledge of
theses occurrences we conducted a small-scale clinical study focusing on the detection of pregnancies recorded in the tooth
cementum. Results obtained from this study are used for further interpretation of TCA (Tooth cementum annulation) analysis
applied on a sample of teeth from archaeological contexts. All samples derived from archaeological sites are from individuals
dating either to the Mesolithic or Neolithic period in the Central Balkan area. The aim of this study is to evaluate results from the
clinical study and compare it to the results obtained from the archaeological sample. In this manner, we hope to tackle the complex question of pregnancies, fertility rates, and paleodemography at the advent of the Neolithic period.
