δ15N data from ossicles and incremental dentine, we investigated how two developmental periods of the ossicles, in-utero and
first two years of life, reflect in collagen obtained from the ossicles.
Ossicle and tooth samples of 12 individuals aged 0.5 ± 0.4 years to 13 ± 1 years from the 19th century St. Peter`s burial ground
in Blackburn were collected and subjected to the isotopic analyses of carbon and nitrogen. The results showed a significant and
systematic offset between ossicles and dentine formed at the approximately same time. Based on the comparisons with the
incremental dentine and offset pattern, it seems that the second phase of the ossicle development does not influence the isotopic values of collagen significantly. It thus suggests that the data from the ossicles reflect the in-utero period and could serve
as a biomarker for the diet and physiology of the mother during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.
