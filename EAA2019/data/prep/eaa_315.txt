and motherhood. We address how women with physical impairments and disabilities might be identified among those who became mothers or remained childless.
We will also address the relationship between physical impairment and abuse, asking whether and to what extent physical impairment triggered violence against women, and whether we can identify abuse as the cause of disabilities.
Research on motherhood emerges from the ERC-Starting Grant project ‘The value of mothers to society’ (KRS, DPK), while the
MSCA project CoPOWER (EP) focuses on marginality and social exclusion in late prehistoric Europe.
