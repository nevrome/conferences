The neonatal line is a particular band of incremental growth lines that forms within the tooth enamel in both primary and permanent teeth. It becomes visible shortly after birth and it could be seen in the histological sections. In forensic science is it used
as a sign of live birth. Clinical studies have shown that the width of the neonatal line could indicate the possible difficulties of
childbirth. Namely, the wider the neonatal line is, more stressful and longer the birthing process was. We applied this technique
to a sample of milk teeth of newborn babies excavated at Mesolithic and Neolithic sites in the Danube Gorges. At the sites of Lepenski Vir and Vlasac there are over 20 recorded newborn burials. For a better understanding of mortuary practices in Prehistory,
it is of utmost importance to know whether these were live born or stillborn babies. This data could provide elements for further
interpretation of the relationship towards birthing and dying, as well as birthing difficulties and document premature live births.
