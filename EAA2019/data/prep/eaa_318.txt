Breastfeeding and weaning are important biological processes, with great impact on the evolution and mental development of
humans and primates. The duration of breastfeeding affects the cognitive and emotional development of infants as well as the
growth of a population, through fertility, morbidity and mortality rates. Breastfeeding procedures are highly affected by cultural, religious and socio-economic factors while also determine the way social identities and norms are shaped. Moreover infant
feeding patterns can inform us on childhood social identities and parental investment. Studies on breastfeeding and weaning
patterns in the past, are mostly based on the application of incremental dentine analysis. This analysis is able to reconstruct
infant feeding practices by tracking the isotopic swifts of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) of human tissues.
Our project studies breastfeeding and weaning patterns in Roman Thessaloniki (40 BC-400 AD) on a set of skeletal remains
deriving from the eastern and western cemetery of the city. We apply the novel technique of incremental dentine analysis on
permanent first molars in order to track the duration of breast milk consumption as well as the onset/offset of weaning. Through
this, we seek to improve our understanding of the biological implications of these patterns for mothers and children such as the
nutritional and health status and the reproductive strategies through these ages. On the bottom line, we focus on unfolding the
