LESSONS FROM LEIDEN
Author(s): Brandenburgh, Chrystel (Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreken)
Presentation Format: Oral
The city of Leiden in The Netherlands is highly populated, densely built and ambitious in terms of economic growth and development. It is also a city with a distinct historic identity, more than 3000 monumental buildings and a city-outlay with canals and
streets which originates in the middle ages.
One of the challenges many historic cities face is sustaining its historic identity and in the meantime allowing it to be used by itâ€™s
occupants and to be modernised. This means that buildings and the archaeological heritage are being protected where possible,
but sometimes have to make room for new developments. This paper focusses on the way the city deals with the cases where
we have to sacrifice part of our history. How do we choose what to protect and what not? How do we turn our loss into a gain by
ensuring what is lost is documented? How do we combine different types of science to enrich our knowledge of the past? And
lastly, how do we return this knowledge to the city and use it as an opportunity to improve the living conditions and wellbeing of
its inhabitants?
