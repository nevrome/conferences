Author(s): Tonnetti, Alex (The New School of Social Research, NSSR, and Parsons. Independent Research.)
Presentation Format: Oral
Questions: 1.how to recover urban zones whose value has been overshadowed by the concentration of the cultural heritage load
on specific zones assimilated as emblematic, or iconic, or symbolic, or representative of a city. 2. how to address the diversity
and complexity of different heritage zones in a city, to recover a sense of continuity between zones which evolved in distinct
historical times 3. how to find a balance between different historical heritages which are potentially meaningful for the World
Heritage.
Examples: In Italian cities, the world heritage concentrates on Renaissance times, neglecting post-industrial sites, which still
represent a value in term of historical landmarks and collective memory. These latter often witness abandonment and dismissal,
when side tracked from more attractive areas for tourism and foreign investments. We explore the possibility of a re-evaluation
of industrial sites and prisons that were redesigned according to new urban functions, drawing comparisons between Florence,
Milan and other cities’ peripheries.
