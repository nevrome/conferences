In a larger scope of analysis, the Mediterranean Cities’ value for the World Heritage often boils down to the Ancient, Medieval,
and Early Modern periods, leaving other historical parts in the darkness. In terms of the character, these peripheral areas often
present a sense of shame for tarnishing the bright iconicity of inner city. This however brings risks such as a) creating imbalance
of the urban development and growth, b) misperception of the collective memory of the city as a place, with the inner city turned
into the sole repository of the urban authenticity and of the official collective memory of the city, d) indiscriminate modernization of the peripheries, and breaking a sense of continuity between the different parts of the whole organic fabric of the city.”
