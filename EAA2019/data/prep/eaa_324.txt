VISUALIZING THE INVISIBLE. A MODERN INDUSTRIAL CITY WITH A LIVING ARCHAEOLOGICAL
HERITAGE

Presentation Format: Oral
At first sight the city of Oss (southern-Netherlands) appears to be a small and ordinary, modern city where history seems to be
erased. Little of the medieval origin of the city and its unique 19th and 20th century industrial history has been preserved. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, much was demolished in the context of large spatial developments.
At the same time, the extensive rebuilding and expansion of the city has triggered a large-scale archaeological research project.
Since the 1970s, hundreds of hectares have been investigated, dozens of which have been excavated.
Over the last 15 years the municipality put a lot of effort in the utilisation of the knowledge from all that research. In this lecture
I want to illustrate how ‘invisible’ archaeological heritage and their accompanying narratives can not only be visualized but also
engaged for a livable and sustainable environment. Visualizing the invisible archaeological heritage also created awareness for
contemporary dwellers that they live in an environment that once was occupied by previous generations.
Finally the archaeological heritage contributes to the city-branding. The city of Oss has been struggling for decades with a negative image. Making her deep history part of the identity of 21st century city not only makes inhabitants ‘proud’ of their city, it
also contributes to a more positive city image.
