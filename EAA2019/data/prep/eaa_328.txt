Presentation Format: Oral
In 2011, Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The historic centre of the Barbados’ capital city, together with its nearby military garrison, is a unique example of British colonial architecture. The historic city is
characterized by a distinctive 17th-century serpentine street lay-out and includes a large number of historic monuments dating
from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.
At the same time, Bridgetown is a vibrant city and home to no less than 110,000 people. In addition, Barbados welcomes another
38460 tourist visitors each month on average, most of whom also visit Bridgetown to enjoy the city life and to benefit from the
many tax free purchase opportunities. Adding this to the fact that the city is also the government and business centre of the
island, it makes one curious to find out how well the dynamics of a vibrant city life go together with a seemingly more static heritage situation in this particular example. In addition, Barbados is a small island developing state (SIDS), which has implications for
the possibilities for management and protection of the island’s cultural heritage.
This paper will focus on how different stakeholders are using and experiencing Bridgetown’s World Heritage Site, and some challenges and success stories relating to heritage preservation will be highlighted.
