The Old Town of Galle and its Fortifications gained heritage recognition in 1988 due to its Dutch colonial architecture (under the
criterion iv). Since inscription, it has experienced increasing gentrification as a result of a booming tourism industry combined
with stringent local heritage policies, which prioritize the preservation of Dutch colonial architectural heritage over the local
community. This paper surveys the gentrification levels of the city with qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. It also
analyzes the reasons behind these processes, focusing on local and international heritage policies. It argues that the exponential increase in land value of the fort, a direct result of heritage recognition, has turned the ordinary colonial town house into a
commodity that caters to tourists in various ways. Today, the majority of town houses are either owned or leased by local and
foreign investment companies and businessmen, causing a population drop by one third. While one fifth of private properties
are currently owned or leased by foreign investors, by contrast, residential buildings in the city have dropped by half. Conflicting
interests persist between the heritage authorities and the community over developing properties. While the conservation goals
of the heritage authorities in preserving colonial built heritage is partially fulfilled, the whole process has displaced the local
residents.
