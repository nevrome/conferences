three farms appear, probably after the landowners’ land holdings were reorganized.
Two farms had a continuous settlement until 1800, while one had a deserted period between 1400–1600, probably as a result of
the plague. Several ovens revealed that the farmers had been working with beer brewing alongside agriculture and also handled
fish in large quantities.
During the Middle Ages was barley the most common grain, from 1600 it was rye. Animal husbandry seems to have been successful. Milk cows and pigs may have been brought to the town for slaughter and there were signs of specialization on goose
grooming. In the kitchen gardens they cultivated cabbage plants, peas and flax, in order to expand with more plants during late
medieval times. The farms were family-based agricultural units that required the peasants to have good coordination and cooperation. Although they did not own the land, we see that there was room for them to find different opportunities for surplus
production.
