This paper concerns the oldest roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula which became the Roman city of Tarraco. Established
during the second Punic war, Tarraco was the capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior and later of Hispania Tarraconensis but is known nowadays by the name Tarragona, which is the capital of the southern region of Catalunya, Tarragona in Spain. In
2000 Tarraco was made a World Heritage site by UNESCO.
Like a lot of modern cities that have developed around an older city, a large amount of the Roman archaeology has been utilised to
build later buildings and walls. While there has been a lot of damage due to various regional disputes which saw Tarragona coming
repeatedly worse off to its northern sister city of Barcelona, there is a tremendous amount of impressive Roman archaeology
still accessible of which the city is rightly proud of.
But Tarragona is a living vibrant city, and it is not only its Roman heritage that needs to be preserved but its rich medieval, Napoleonic, and republican heritage that also needs to be celebrated and acknowledged.
This paper takes an outsider’s view of this wonderful city and examines the problems the Country, Region and City have in preserving and developing all aspects of this precious heritage for future generations to come. It will look at not only the funding
aspects but the logistics, the legal requirements and the social inclusion of keeping this city a hidden jewel on the Mediterranean
coast.
