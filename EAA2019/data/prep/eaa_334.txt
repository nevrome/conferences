to preserve archaeological sites. One example is the Moscow-Kazan Highway, where the IA RAN has been involved for the past
three years.
Russian archaeological sites are imperilled when near to hydroelectric installations – risking flooding of ancient long-inhabited
areas.
In recent years, the IA RAS surveyed before construction of hydro-electric installations in the middle reaches of European Russia’s largest river, the Volga – at the Cheboksary Hydroelectric Station.
The affected area was studied by our Institute, including collaboration with local museums and universities. Locations and
boundaries of archaeological sites were determined, and a list of preservation measures been set up. As a result of the survey,
121 archaeological sites emerged as at risk of damage. The overall area of archaeological sites which require rescue archaeological excavation totals 432,486 square metres. Our hope is that the Cheboksary facility will not go ahead - and that the threatened sites will be saved.
Collections made as the result of excavations further expand material in Russia’s local museums.
