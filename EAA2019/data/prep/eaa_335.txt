MANAGING CHANCE. HERITAGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT, A TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Presentation Format: Oral
Companies with their business operations have a major impact on the environment, our surroundings, economy and society as a
whole. Many impact assessments have already been developed to map this impact.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is common practice in most parts of the developed world, this is not the case for Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) though. Why not? Do we value our cultural environment less than our natural physical environment? Or is it because the tool is more recent and still unknown? Dutch policymakers are negative towards including HIA as part
of the set of prescribed assessments because they are afraid it would hamper development.
Culture is an important part of sustainable development because it touches on a number of important goals such as inclusiveness , the right to cultural heritage and the quality of the living environment. In my paper I will demonstrate that HIA is by no means
a conservation tool. I will reflect how HIA fits in a sustainable business management and I will argue that HIA should become part
of the compliance of those companies that have an actual impact on our environment.
