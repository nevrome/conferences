example, past fluctuating descriptions of Cycladic figurines as ‘primitive small monsters’ or as great works of minimalist art (see
commentary in Gill and Chippindale 1993). Moreover, alongside such phenomena arose discussions that the appearance of ancient figurines resulted directly from their makers’ artistic skill, and that artistic skill developed chronologically (see commentary
in Zeimbeki 2004).
In the light of recent archaeological theoretical and methodological developments, the aforementioned approaches are now
debatable. In this session, we therefore explore new avenues for understanding what other factors may have influenced the
appearance of ancient figurines. In deconstructing the concept of ‘artistic skill’ and ‘style’ (see Cochrane and Meirion-Jones
2018) we consider afresh the idea of ‘design’ behind appearance. We also seek to more closely investigate the role of materials
in artefact production, alongside the general impact of human cognitive and perceptual development upon design processes.
We address the following questions:
•
What impacts do materials used in figurine production have upon the development of skilled behaviour?
•
How are perceptual relationships influenced and facilitated by specific materials and styles?
•
In what ways do production of, and engagement with, representations of bodies and faces impact cognitive processes?
•
Is it truly possible to assess developments in figurine appearance chronologically and stylistically?
•
Do concepts such as typology, sub-varieties, and a focus upon identifying specific “artists”, still provide useful frameworks?
•
What would new methodologies or alternative aesthetics for interpreting the development of figurine appearance
consist of?
We accept papers concerning any form of ancient figurine. We impose no geographical or chronological limitations.”
