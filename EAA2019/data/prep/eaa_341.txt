cognitive science, we can trace HOW they were thinking.
Hence, this paper, which is based on my PhD-project within the research training group “Early Concepts of Humans and Nature:
universal, specific, interchanged” (DFG-GRK 1876), proposes a methodology which combines traditional approaches from archaeology and image studies with results from cognitive science to recover the underlying ideas about the human body. By the
means of a case study from Egyptian Pre- and Early Dynastic anthropomorphic sculpture (approx. mid/late 5. millennium B.C. –
2700 B.C.) the benefits of this approach will be demonstrated.
