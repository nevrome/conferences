Presentation Format: Oral
Malleable clay deposited naturally into the depths of a newly discovered cave in 2011 was the raw material used to create more
than 50 clay reliefs and sculptures resting on natural terraces of the same material. Unlike figurines, these are not three-dimensional objects that can be lifted and transported. The majority of these figures portray human beings, mainly female, with
distinctive facial features. Based on the preliminary results of collaborative fieldwork in 2018 with the Ayuujk people of Oaxaca,
the knowledge and skill required to give shape to clay in a subterranean landscape will be explored. In this paper, I discuss the
importance of the aesthetic quality of the final result but will also emphasise the creation/creative process and design behind
this extremely rare material culture found along a subterranean river. The display and arrangement of a vast repertoire of clay
figures and succinct rock art might be showcasing a memorising technique that Mesoamerican cultures used to narrate and
pass on culture.
