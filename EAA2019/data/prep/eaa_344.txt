In the Archaic Period, Egyptianising objects including figurines were mass-produced on Rhodes and at Naucratis in a non-clay
ceramic which we typically call Egyptian faience.
Recently, progress has been made in understanding the composition of ‘Greek’ faience and the locations and techniques of its
manufacture. However, the matter of how the properties of this material and the processes of its production shaped its conceptual and perceptual qualities in the Greek world has been overlooked.
In firing from a brown or pale paste to a hard, glossy, turquoise finish, faience was a unique substance, paralleled only by precious
stones but used by a broad range of social classes. Egyptological studies have highlighted how faience’s raw materials, malleability, and self-glazing properties held special significance, including in faience figurines’ association with concepts of ‘being and
becoming’ in religious and magical practices.
It is only natural, therefore, that we should now consider how this alchemical process was perceived in the Greek world. In this
paper, I will discuss the relationship between faience’s raw materials, its production, and its uses in Greek contexts by addressing a range of questions: Was faience conceptually different to clay? Why were Egyptianising figurines not made in clay? Were
