Cultural assemblages associated with the evidence of the use of various pigments in Siberia appeared around 50–40 ka BP.
Initial Upper Paleolithic Siberian sites such as Kara-Bom, Denisova Cave, Malaya Syya, Khotyk-3, and Kamenka demonstrate variations in forms, colors, and ways of pigment use. Multi-element composition of pigment materials was obtained through SEMEDX analysis, and showed differences in the use of various natural ingredients. Composite pigments and a wider color spectrum,
including red, blue and green colors, replace the use of natural pigments (goethite, hematite, limonite, malachite, azurite and
colorful clays) and mixed, artificial formulations of the Upper Paleolithic Siberian collections.
Microscopic examination and identification of traces reveal the presence of ornamental decoration and complex pigments composition on the surface of items of personal ornament and sculptures in Siberian Classic Upper Paleolithic sites, such as Khotyk-2, Ust’-Cova, Mal’ta, Buret’ and Yana-site, for example. Of particular interest is the plot coloring (red, black, green, blue) of
anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines which we found in the collections of Ust’-Kova, Shestakovo, Mal’ta and Buret’(19-23
ka BP).
The use of natural pigments in culture has two aspects: daily utilitarian and symbolic. Household use of pigments, especially
ochre, is known from ethnographic materials as antiseptic, adhesive material, skin softener and as a mineral addition for food.
We are very grateful to the Russian Foundation for Basic Research for funding this study (project No. 17-56-16016).
