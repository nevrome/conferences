FIGURINES FROM BOEOTIA

In Mycenaean Greece, most terracotta figurines were small and modeled (c. 1400-1100 BC), but large wheel-made or clay-coil
examples, which have been termed figures or statuettes, were hollow (c. 1300-1150 BC). If the function of the female figurines
and figures have long been at the center of the debate – the first being usually regarded as offerings and the second as cult statuettes or a part of a cult equipment (e.g. at Mycenae and Tiryns) –, the production technique outside the Argolid did not attract
a great attention.
This paper aims to explore the links between production techniques, shapes and visual effects of hollow terracotta figures and
figurines in the Late Bronze Age. A special attention will be paid to the painted decoration, in order to better assess their chronological development, as it has been already proposed for Mycenaean figurines (anthropomorphic and zoomorphic). This research
will mainly focus on figures and figurines from Boeotia, including two figures from Thebes and a figurine from Tanagra. This last
piece is of particular interest, since it seems to display morphological and technical characteristics of Minoan figurines, but
close examination reveals that its lower part is not hollow.
