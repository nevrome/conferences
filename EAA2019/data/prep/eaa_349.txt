It is worth recalling that, in Crete, from the beginning of the Late Minoan period (c. 1600 BC), some terracotta figurines were modeled and solid, but most female figurines had a hollow cylindrical inferior part. It is generally accepted that this inferior part was
wheel-made, possibly wheel-thrown or wheel-fashioned. However, a handmade shaping was also a plausible option. This raises
the question of how hollow zoomorphic figurines and figures were produced in the Aegean Bronze Age. It comprises hollow animal
figures seen as zoomorphic vessels, likely used as cult paraphernalia, which were part of a long tradition in the Bronze Age both
on the Greek mainland, Boeotia included, and on the Aegean islands.
