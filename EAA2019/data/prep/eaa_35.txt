This paper explores the outcomes of a programme of one-metre square archaeological ‘test pit’ excavations within currently occupied rural settlements (CORS) in England. Here, only around 10% of medieval settlements subsequently became permanently
deserted, and these are in any case atypical, being on average smaller, less favourably located and very unevenly distributed
when compared to their non-deserted counterparts – today’s villages, hamlets and small towns. Thus it is vital that research into
rural settlements includes sites which are still inhabited today, but this can be difficult due to their presently built-up character.
One solution to these difficulties is the use of a sampling strategy involving the excavation of multiple very small trenches which
can be squeezed into unbuilt-up spaces such as gardens within today’s rural settlements. Over 13 years, the English CORS Project has involved the excavation of more than 2000 such ‘test pits’ in more than 60 settlements, and mapped the distribution
of pottery of different dates to reconstruct which parts of settlements were inhabited at different times. This paper considers what such data are telling us that is new about the long-term development of rural settlements, selecting two themes for
particular focus: firstly the widespread nature of evidence for dynamic volatility which suggests that turbulent change was
a near-universal experience for settlements in the medieval period (and not just restricted to deserted sites); and secondly
exploring evidence which suggests that many 19th century settlement plans (often presumed to represent earlier layouts) are
of relatively recent origin, dating in many cases not to the medieval period but later. The paper concludes by noting that similar
techniques could be used effectively elsewhere in Europe.
