Presentation Format: Oral
The papers deals with the appearance of anthropomorphic images in the Early Bronze Age coroplastic (c. 3000-2000 BC) and discusses its meaning in ancient Syria and Mesopotamia from a diachronic perspective. Is the presence of regional figurine types
the result of cultural and ideological differences? How does the development of specific manufacturing techniques influence
this popular handicraft production? A detailed characterization of the figurines, achieved through archaeometric analysis and
morpho-typological features will be used for the identification of regional groups and local workshops, in order to investigate
how the manufacturing process interacts with cultural preferences for specific anthropomorphic imagery. The debated question of the identification of male and female figures as humans or supra-natural beings will be also analyzed, taking into account
the apotropaic and magic rituals of breaking and burning clay figurines. The various anthropomorphic categories will be finally
compared with the artistic production of composite figurines in precious materials dated to the same period. Focusing on the
Early Dynastic/Early Syrian period, the materials from ancient Ebla in Northern Syria will be presented together with textual data
from the Eblaic cuneiform archives (c. 2400-2300 BC) in order to investigate the relation between the high artistic production of
composite statutettes/standards and ‘popular’ terracotta figurines.
