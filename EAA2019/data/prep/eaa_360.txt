Presentation Format: Oral
Hong Kong has been a gateway for illegally acquired antiquities from Mainland China for a long time. A largely ungoverned situation makes it easy for local dealers to launder items and export them internationally. The topographical characteristics of the
area make Hong Kong a place which is hard to control. The rugged coastline is difficult to guard and the administrative borders
leave convenient loopholes for smugglers. The antiquities trade is facilitated by individuals and organizational entities specializing in the transport of illicit goods. However, other than with Mediterranean antiquities, there is very little risk awareness of
market participants, offering a chance to learn more about the structure and functionality of the network. This talk will give a
preliminary insight into how illegally excavated items from Mainland China find their way into Hong Kong and what methods are
employed by different network nodes in order to distribute risk and maximize profit.
