From the very first days of radiocarbon dating method in the early 1950â€™s, the importance of this chronometer to studies of
human history was recognized. The advent of the accelerator mass spectrometry AMS and a substantial downscaling of sample
sizes from grams to milligrams of material opened the doors for dating precious objects of cultural heritage. The last decades
have witnessed an increased interest in applications of the 14C dating of art and cultural heritage objects. Among material studied typically are parchment, textiles, paper, and wood. Developments have been made in the analysis of less common materials
such as iron, mortar, binding media and pigments.
Other technical developments lead to an increase in capacity of existing AMS laboratories. Moreover, new laboratories including
so-called satellite laboratories have been established. This creates more opportunities for the antiquities markets for using 14C
analysis to validate antique objects. A unified approach to this problem is proposed by the radiocarbon community. However,
future collaborations with museums and institutions of cultural heritage protection are needed to increase effectiveness and
assure that 14C is not used to drive illicit antiquity trade. This paper is a summary of the ongoing activities and a call for an interdisciplinary co-operation.
