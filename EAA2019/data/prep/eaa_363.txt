MUSEUM SALVAGE: RENEWED HOPE FOR UNPROVENIENCED ARTEFACTS

Presentation Format: Poster
As archaeologists, looting is the bane of our existence. Unfortunately, it can also be a hobby and passion for those interested
but generally uneducated in the realm of cultural heritage and the value of proper field recordation methods. What happens to
looted objects may vary – often times they end up in a museum’s possession, where they are considered “safe” from the illegal
antiquities market, but due to their illicit origin they are then imprisoned to a life of sitting on a shelf in storage rather than contributing to our knowledge of the past. These unprovenienced artifacts are ostracized by professionals because they have been
detached from much of their scientific value, and to study such haphazardly obtained artifacts may have the potential to encourage further looting attempts. This ultimately presents a risk for museum workers that house such objects, challenging how we
may begin to approach and interact with these materials. This project addresses the controversial nature of ethics involved in
studying noncontextualized artifacts in museum collections, using the ceramic collection at the Lancaster Museum of Art and
History (MOAH) in Lancaster, California (USA) as a case study to address the possible benefits of looking further into these lost
artefacts through the concept of museum salvage.
