islative support. Nevertheless, the trend is for greater recognition of historical archaeology with universities, museums, and
government agencies increasing their commitment to the heritage of the recent past. Current socio-political shifts highlight
the tensions between nationalism and regionalism, colonialism and post-colonialism, industrialisation and post-industrialisation,
and reactions for and against globalisation. These are all tensions which post-medieval archaeologists study with a unique material time depth, and case studies will examine how individuals or communities operated within these larger parameters and
the ways in which they contributed to or limited these trends through their actions. This session, sponsored by the Society for
Post-Medieval Archaeology, will allow these issues to be discussed as national experiences within a European context, and will
celebrate the continuing increased appreciation of the archaeology of the last half millennium. The papers will be relevant to the
Berne theme of ‘EAA 25’ by examining how current projects sit within the historiography of the archaeology of recent times in the
relevant countries and regions, whilst celebrating best practice within the presenters’ contemporary heritage politics.
