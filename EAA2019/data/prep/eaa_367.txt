EARLY MODERN SWEDEN

Presentation Format: Oral
Recent decades of developments within historical archaeology has spurred the interest in the past of Scandinavia’s’ indigenous
population: The Sámi. The deep history and the geographically wide spread evidence of Sámi presence in the past has been of
decisive importance for a wider understanding of a multicultural past. Implementation of experiences from North American historical archaeology has meant a growing critique of earlier emphasis on acculturation and homogeneity. Instead current research
has showed a wide variety of Sámi life ways, practices and strategies, in central Sweden during the early modern period and a
plethora of interactions with the majority society. This paper focus on the ethnic cleansing during the early eighteenth century
and the creation of an indenture system specially dedicated to Sámi people that developed during the following centuries only to
be dissolved during the twentieth century. Ongoing archaeological field work has been able to unfold evidence of resilient Sámi
communities, existing side by side with the majority society both under severe constrain but also developing own identities.
Through archaeology a hitherto almost untold history has addressed and scrutinized.
