new trend.
The aim of this contribution is to offer an ananalysis of the reasons why our discipline is adapting last. The information provided
emerge from my PhD fieldwork in the mountains of Zagori (NW Greece) and through theoretical investigations regarding the
potential nature of an Ottoman archaeology in Greece. I will address the multidisciplinary nature of landscape archaeology and
suggest that an Ottoman archaeology in Greece must grow anthropological reflexes, as it is summoned to interpret an era widely
considered as the ”national other”. I will also argue that substantial knowledge of regional Ottoman history has to complement
relevant endeavors, and provide an example of bad practice. Last, I will debate the positioning of archaeologists in relationship
to local communities and ”their” heritage, baptised by 19th and early 20th century folklorists in bipolar narratives regarding the
”bad Turk”.
I believe that a montane approach is important for methodological issues. Mountains in the national narrative evoke the values of
primitivism and backwardism. Only when it comes to revolution (against the Ottomans) or resistance against foreign occupiers
(WWII), they are glorified. Nevertheless, local histories and material culture tell different stories when it comes to the Ottoman
past...
