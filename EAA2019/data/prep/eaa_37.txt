in two seasons of test pit surveys. Over the summers of 2017 and 2018 holes were dug across the village as we attempted to
answer a series of questions. Was there any evidence for Saxon activity? How far could we push back the archaeology of the site
and where were the Medieval manors that once surrounded the village? In addition to the test pits, LiDAR data was studied and
investigated on the ground, old maps were interrogated, aerial photos examined and a drone used to take new photos of the area.
Oral history testimony also added to our understanding of the recent development of the village. This paper will set out the findings of this three-year, Lottery funded, community archaeology project. It will also evaluate the approaches used and challenges
encountered in delivering these types of activities.
