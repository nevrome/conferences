RESEARCHING THE POST-MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE DERWENT VALLEY MILLS WORLD
HERITAGE SITE, UK
Author(s): Knight, David (York Archaeological Trust)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Derwent Valley mills and the associated infrastructure of workers’ housing, schools, churches, canals, railways and other
built remains, together with the surrounding landscape, were inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2001 in recognition of the importance of the area for the development of the factory system. Much has been written about the Valley’s textile
mills, industrial housing and other built remains, but significantly less research has been conducted on the lead mining and smelting sites, charcoal-burning platforms, stone quarries and other post-medieval archaeological sites that lie concealed in woodlands along the valley sides or are buried beneath floodplain alluvium. A recently published Research Framework for the World
Heritage Site has highlighted the rich industrial archaeological resource of the Derwent Valley and has identified key priorities for
post-medieval research. We will consider how the granting of World Heritage Site status has impacted upon strategies for survey
and investigation of the Valley’s archaeological resource, how the Research Framework that was developed as a requirement for
maintaining the Site’s status with UNESCO has guided recent research, and the challenges posed by current social, economic
and environmental pressures.
