Post-medieval archaeology has become a one of the major sub-fields in the Finnish archaeological research. It has been mainly
focused on early modern urbanization, especially in Northern Finnish towns, and how this urbanization was connected to global
urbanization. The archaeology of the recent past has been examined as well, mainly sites and memories of 20th century conflicts, especially World War II. In our paper we will discuss the difficulties early modern archaeology and, especially, the archaeology of the recent past has faced in Finnish heritage policy. We will use the 20th century industrial and World War II sites in
northern urban contexts to stress the importance of the archaeological research to preserve the data of the past, not only for
contemporary research but for future archaeology. We are facing more and more problems studying the 20th century urban
archaeological sites and preserving the material culture from these sites for the future.
