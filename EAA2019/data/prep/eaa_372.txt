The ways in which the archaeology of medieval monastic sites have been approached is an excellent mirror of the wider attitudes
to post-medieval archaeology in Britain. Early 20th-century excavators concentrated on exposing medieval ruins, and even removing later building elements, but by the later 20th century it was more often recognised that the later deposits were of value
and should be recorded to some degree. Monastic sites often have complex site biographies that last as many centuries after
their closure as religious sites at the Reformation as they did in their monastic state. Only relatively recently, however, has the
archaeological potential of these biographies been recognised, with research explicitly directed at post-Dissolution phases both
in terms of analysing standing remains and through excavations. Using the example of Norton Priory, the most extensively scientifically excavated site in Europe, this shift in emphasis is demonstrated by comparing the campaigns of the 1970s and early
1980s and the recently commenced long-term research programme where the post-Dissolution is a major period of interest.
We can see a shift from ignoring the post-medieval, to partial recording and analysis of deposits and finds, to the generation
of narratives that continue through the post-Dissolution phases. The final stage of articulating specific research aims that are
