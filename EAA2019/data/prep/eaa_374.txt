Developing in a post-colonial context, Irish archaeology’s early years focused on the prehistoric and early medieval periods, fashioning an appropriate past for the new state. Serious interest in the archaeology of the post-medieval period was slow to develop,
only gathering significant pace in the late 1990s. Prior to this, vernacular material culture was largely studied under the aegis
of folklore. In part due to the largely aceramic character of medieval Gaelic Ireland, and their reputation as a ‘foreign’ or ‘intrusive’ aspect of material culture, commercially-produced ceramics have historically received little attention by researchers in
this area. Ó Duilearga, for example, in his foreword to the Handbook of Irish Folklore (1942), lamented how the ‘shoddy imported
culture of the towns push back the frontiers of the indigenous homespun culture of the countryside’. More recent scholarship
has acknowledged the centrality of mass-produced commodities in rural households, but much work remains to be done on
domestic materiality during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Archaeology offers a unique insight into quotidian practices, and consumption patterns during the recent past. Drawing on evidence from excavated, coupled with folklore and Gaelic
vocabularies, this paper seeks to tease out shifting material practices among rural populations in the west of Ireland during this
period. It examines the variety of domestic vessels used (wood, wicker, coarse earthenware, and refined earthenware) parsing
their multiple meanings in the context of broader material and (gendered) social practices. Finally, it considers the impact of
discourses such as improvement on these practices, and how they changed over time.
