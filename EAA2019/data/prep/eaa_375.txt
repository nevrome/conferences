This paper uses 18 years of targeted ﬁeldwork on excavating workers’ housing in the Manchester city region, UK, to assess a
variety of research approaches to the investigation of urban industrial housing of the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries.
Manchester was one of the ‘shock’ cities of industrial Britain, and a honey pot for social commentary during the Victorian period. Using data from more than 35 excavation sites, this paper looks at the way in which archaeological evidence can be used
to explore issues around house build quality, overcrowding, sanitation and disease, and reconstructing households from their
material remains. Manchester’s reputation for poor living conditions during the industrialising period was crystallised around
the comments of contemporary social commentators from Engels to Gaskell. Yet, the archaeological evidence reviewed here
demonstrates the value of archaeological approaches in challenging and testing such views through detailed case studies. More
importantly, it shows that archaeological material can be used to study directly features of the new industrialised form of urban
living, providing a set of research questions applicable across the industrial urban workers’ housing of Britain and beyond.
