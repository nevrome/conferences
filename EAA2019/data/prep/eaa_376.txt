Presentation Format: Poster
Inhabited since prehistory, the southern part of Sicily in the area between the ancient settlement of Kaukana and Kamarina is
packed with archaeological sites. The area, frequently a point of contention between the ancient populations, preserves in his
waters many shipwrecks, and along the coast many sites that can be dated back from prehistory to modern times.
The University of Udine, cooperating with the Sicilian Soprintendenza del Mare and with the support of Institute of Nautical
Archaeology, from 2017 is leading the “Kaukana” project, which has the aim to survey the coastal landscape and analyse the
already known shipwrecks to recognize new sites (both on land and underwater) with the purpose of understanding the dynamics
of management and use of the coastal space in the past.
This paper will present the first results that, thanks to a wide and deep coastal and underwater survey, allowed to better document some already known shipwrecks and to locate new shipwrecks, to identify ancient moorings and, thanks to a productive
historical research, reconstruct the methods of interaction between the coast and the main land.
