verified with knowledge in the history of the region.
Cultural anthropologists used photography, written materials, archives, documents and available studies. The source of knowledge about the past and the present, however, was for them primarily spoken story, stories of people met and heard. As part of

years has been carried out.
The project was implemented from the European Regional Development Fund, Interreg V-A Poland-Slovakia 2014-2020, Axis
