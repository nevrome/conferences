Archaeological excavations in Brabant (BE & NL) have revealed a puzzling development of the medieval settlement. Around the
early thirteenth century the coversand area saw a widespread settlement relocation. Across the region the traditional settlement locations amidst the fields were abandoned and the settlements were relocated, sometimes even leaving behind their
church. It is assumed that the inhabitants moved to the sites of the present-day villages, although so far archaeological evidence to back this up has been scarce.
The data on medieval rural settlement primarily stems from the countryside. Very few excavations have been conducted within
the historical villages themselves. Because of this, our understanding of the development of rural settlement is mainly based
on deserted settlements. This imbalance is problematic, as the relation with the development of the historical villages remains
unclear. Since archaeological research in the area is solely development-led the bias in our dataset will only continue to increase.
To address this problem a purposeful research project was created to study the origins and development of the historical villages. Since the villages are presently inhabited the required archaeological observations will inevitable intrude into private property. This was not regarded as a problem, but rather an opportunity to involve the inhabitants in the exploration of their own village
and we adopted a community archaeology approach. This initiative received great local support and we are now working with
seven village communities in the Groene Woud area in North-Brabant (NL). In this paper we will present our initial findings.
