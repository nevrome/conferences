Presentation Format: Oral
There are at least three main characteristics common for most of the urnfield cultures in Central Europe in the late Bronze and
early Iron Age: prevailing cremation, intense growth of number of graves and cemeteries and common incorporation of ceramics
in funeral rituals. None of these have been so clear in archaeological evidence before the urnfield period and hundreds of pots
filled with cremated human bones became an iconic picture of the late Bronze Age in many regions of Central Europe. That opens
many research areas on the various levels: from microarchaeology of single urn to broad comparative regional and supra-regional
studies. We want to present how this approaches have been realized in selected case studies from Central Europe in three stages of research. First level refers to the characteristics of a single burial or grave. At the second level selected properies of graves
are studied both in synchronic and diachronic perspective while third level encompasses intra-site analysis.
This study is a part of the project of the Polish National Centre for Science, NCN UMO-2016/23/B/HS3/00450.
