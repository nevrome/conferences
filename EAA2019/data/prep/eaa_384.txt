In the south of France and northern Spain, archaeological research on the Urnfields has long focused on two opposing points of
view, either in favour of population movements or indigenous developments, to explain the appearance and subsequent generalisation of large cremation necropolises across Europe from the Late Bronze Age onward. These approaches led to dead-ends. In
this paper, we leave aside the problem of the origins to focus on the internal components of the phenomenon, in a diachronic way.
We consider that each necropolis is characterized by a set of funerary practices (organization of tombs, architecture of tombs,
method of depositing human remains, etc.) which change through time. An analytic grid including 62 descriptors, subdivided
in 146 modalities, allows to define what are the funerary combinations specific to each chronological stage of any necropolis.
Multivariate statistical analysis and cartography can therefore be used to identify several groups of archaeological sites which
share identical or close combinations or have very different profiles, and to study how these groups evolve over time.
Such a bottom-up approach leads to new insights regarding several important questions. This study allows both to highlight
the diversity of practices observed in the studied area and the links between some sub-regions previously considered as more
or less independent, bringing to light a more complex funerary and cultural landscape. It is then possible to investigate in a new
