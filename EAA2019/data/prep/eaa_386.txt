This paper will explore mortuary practices in the earliest Urnfield phases of the Northern Balkans / Southern Carpathian Basin,
taking the case of the settlement and cemetery at Gradiste Idjos. Specifically, we will provide new data on the treatment of
individuals whose remains were fragmented and deposited in settlement contexts alongside the development from inhumation
to cremation in formal flat cemeteries typical to the Urnfield tradition. This transition occurs at the time of the development of
Belegis pottery, including a change from the Belegis I style to the Belegis II / Gava style that occurs, in various variants, throughout this wider region.This presentation will incorporate new absolute chronological data for these changes and consider the
implications of the transition from inhumation (in graves and other locations) to cremation with reference to changes in landuse and settlement form that were coevally occurring. Our objective is to on the one hand evaluate the chronological parity
of these developments and on the other hand to use bioarchaeological research to characterise the populations experiencing
these changes.
