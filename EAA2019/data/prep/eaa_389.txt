tively local influences. In this way, they enable us to analyse the way multiple intersecting social identities were materialized in
specific selections of grave goods in local as well as overarching contexts. One the one hand, these representations of identity
allow us to develop a deeper understanding of the different groups that made up Late Urnfield “elites”, their types and their
hierarchies; on the other hand, they also let us draw inferences to the nature of the societies they were embedded in. Employing
methods and theoretical concepts of network analysis, the study focuses especially on the way in which the composition of funeral inventories implies varying degrees of social cohesion, and how these findings relate to the development of the structure
of Hallstatt society as evidenced in the “princely” graves of the late Hallstatt period, but also on the strategies materialized in
grave goods that did not see implementation beyond the end of the Urnfield cultures.
