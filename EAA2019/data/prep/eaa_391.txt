Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation will present the new insight in the Late Bronze Age of the southern Carpathian Basin and northern Balkans. This
region, today parts of continental Croatia and northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, were inhabited by two close related communities known as Virovitica group and Barice-Gređani group.
In past decade several Late Bronze age sites have been thoroughly excavated, so today it is possible to discuss different cemetery patterns, but also of customs and rituals practiced by Late Bronze Age populations in the area. Special attention is dedicated to study of the cremation burial ritual and the organization of cemeteries. In this regard question of existence of grave
marks has been examined. Also, the usage of pottery in burial rite showed to be important in understanding the customs of these
populations. Analysis revealed that pottery used as furnishings could not been used in common daily activities, but that they
were produced intentionally for burial rite. Completely new insight in burial rites was provided with use of computed tomography
and Magnetic Resonance technique. With these methods it was possible to obtain valuable information’s on refined procedures
of funeral ritual.
