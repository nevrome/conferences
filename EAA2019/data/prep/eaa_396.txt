Here we discuss the elements and the structure of the burial practices of cultures with urn-field ne-cropolises, as well as what
distinguishes those from the cultures practicing inhumation in flat or tumular necropolises.
Urn-field necropolises appear prior to 1400/1300 BC, and are synchronous to the Verbicioara phase III. Subsequently, they
emerge as the dominant burial practice of the Central Balkans, while absent from the adjacent regions. By the HaA2 period, urnfields are already near extinct.
Most characteristic of the urn-field necropolises is the practice of depositing the urns in a single level, arranged in a linear or
radial pattern, with space between the structures. The urn-fields occupy comparatively large areas. In most instances, burial
practices include the internment of the remains in a container-urn, which is sometimes covered by a bowl-lid. In one in five burials
were attested gifts, most commonly pottery vessels and bronze adornments. In several necropolises it is possible to establish
a connection between the built burial structure and the position of the structure within the necropolis, making possible the distinction of certain chronologically discrete groups of graves.
In some urn-field graves there are dedicated stone structure around a feature â€“ a tradition attested in inhumation necropolises.
The pottery vessels found in both principle types of necropolises, as well as in inhumation necropolises in general, find parallels
in the southern parts of the Central Balkans. Urn-field necropolises are relatively uniform, while inhumation necropolises manifest greater variability and local specifics.
