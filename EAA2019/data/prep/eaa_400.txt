indicators. It has been commonly agreed that they were made specially for the funeral purposes. Thanks to wider perspective
which incorporate multi- and interdisciplinary studies we could introduce new information about pottery which was involved in
the social and cultural life of a small community at Wicina, SW Poland.
We posted new questions about pottery in settlement and in cemetery contexts. Are vessels produced and used in settlement
area reused as funeral ones? Or were they made especially for burials? What the pathway from settlement to cemetery looked
like?
Great opportunity to answer gives Wicina, which belongs to a settlement micro region (fortified settlement and a few of cremation cemeteries). The settlement is located ca. 800 m from the one of the cemeteries and can be dated with a dendrochronological method to mid.8-mid.6th c. BC. The cemetery is dated to ca. 13-6th c. BC. Such a broad chronology allows observations
of patterns in ceramics production and use in a long-time scale. We could find out about cultural properties of the community
which buried their dead at the urnfield before and after the fortified settlement was constructed, what is unique both in Polish
and Central European archaeology.
Previous results of artefacts analyses obtained at the settlement will be compared to new ones conducted on grave pottery.
Investigations of pottery involved physical, petrographic, SEM-EDS and DTA analyses. The chemical study of organic residues
from pottery by GC-MS analyses, in order to determine their use was also completed. Some of spatial investigations on grave
pottery sets and the comparison to settlement pottery will be presented as well.
This study is a part of the project of the Polish National Centre for Science, NCN UMO-2016/23/B/HS3/00450.
