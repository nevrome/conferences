but still poorly studied within a solid theoretical framework considering landscape, human cognition and behaviour. The current
debate for this area is still stuck to the mere, though essential, description of the material culture. This is partially due to the early
discoveries of many archaeological contexts in this area, such as the statue-stelae and many of the caves considered in this
study, but some preliminary results have proved to be fruitful.
The first step concerns a critical review of the already-known archaeological sites in North-Western Tuscany, in order to set
up a reliable basis for the following analyses within a GIS environment. Thereafter, we will build a model to track mobility and
perception throughout the landscape in the study area, trying to understand diachronic patterns, since many variations in the
use of cave settings or statue-stelae are recorded. Moreover, we will propose a reconstruction of the visualscape, following the
evidences from cave settings (ritual and funerary) and other important landmarks (statue-stelae).
Finally, we will test and further develop the well-established idea of a pastoralist society, building an optimal grazing model. This
will be based on environmental conditions, ethnohistorical information and archaeological data. The most probable path followed
(“transhumance route”) will be based on two different cost surfaces: one anisotropic and energy-based and one based on the
previously defined visualscape. This will permit to address the social complexity in a more robust and quantitative way, contributing to the current archaeological debate.
