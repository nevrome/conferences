Pastoralism has played a key role in the history of Italian communities. Though well known for its coasts, Italy is a largely mountainous country and this altitudinal variation has meant that seasonal mobility had to be implemented as a strategy to care for
livestock efficiently. This is what is generally known as ‘transhumance’, a key feature of many pastoral societies. This lifestyle
has a deep history, dating back to at least the later prehistoric period, with some societies, such as those belonging the Bronze
Age Apennine culture, traditionally associated with a pastoral way of living. The Italian shepherd has remained a central figure
in the development of Italian societies also in historic times, with some of the best known transhumance routes (the so-called
tratturi) dating back to medieval and early modern times. In this paper I will explore the perception of historical pastoralism in
contemporary society and evaluate how archaeological and ethno-archaeological evidence can help in the understanding of its
sociological and ecological value. Examples will be drawn from my work in the Apennine area and Sardinia.
