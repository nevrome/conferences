Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has shown its potential numerous times in archaeological research of forested areas. In the dense
Mediterranean woodlands, it proved to be an irreplaceable technique which almost instantly brings to light countless dry stone
structures – the main constituents of karstic landscapes. This is also the case in Vrsar municipality on the Istrian peninsula
which will be shown as a case study in search of these diachronic structures which reflect traditional land management practices. When compared to surface morphology, which can also be read from ALS data, we can conclude that built structures are
best preserved in areas of poor soil where bedrock is visible on the surface. This land was not suitable for cultivation and for that
reason the most commonly preserved structures are the ones reflecting activities related to pastoralism: boundary walls, pens,
enclosed paths, funnels etc. The differences between arable and pastoral land use affected the survival of structures on those
lands and changes in the pastoral areas were more gradual than those in fertile areas. This means that we are simultaneously
looking at numerous multi temporal remnants of past land uses. There are remains that could be assigned to the Bronze Age, then
ones reflecting major transformations that re-shaped the landscape with no continuity in Roman period, but we are also dealing
with numerous features which cannot easily be dated but rather classified into time sequences. This presentation will discuss
the possibilities and challenges of dating these vernacular structures by (GIS supported) analysis of different types of data such
as ALS, modern and historic aerial photographs and cadastres collated with structural surveys.
