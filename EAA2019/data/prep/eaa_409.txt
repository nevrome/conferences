Presentation Format: Poster
The ethnoarchaeological and ethnohistorical study of foraging practices in Crete and other Aegean Islands will cover the activity
of contemporary foragers in inland and coastal areas, based on seasonality, the differentiation of these practices according to
gender and age, and their importance in the economy of the household or the wider social group. These elements are reflected in
the practices of gathering wild plants, molluscs and salt by modern agricultural populations which can give clues and lead to the
formulation of analogies for societies of the past.
The archaeological evidence for the foraging practices result from residues of fauna, phytoliths and charred fruits and seeds,
skeletal remains and coprolites which give information on the diet of prehistoric populations and their specialized toolkits. Modern gatherers in the Aegean collect a variety of foods such as landsnails, molluscs, wild greens and herbs, mushrooms, and salt,
either as part of their diet or as a means to increase their incomes. Some of these foods are consumed exclusively in the Aegean,
and most of them, if not all, were also gathered by prehistoric foragers. Sites with landsnail consumption have been located
across the Mediterranean dating to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, which are being studied as a possible indicator of
the transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic. Salt has always been an equally important food supplement which was necessary, not only for its taste, but also for the preservation of food.
An overview of these contemporary foraging practices from the rural areas of Crete and other islands of the Aegean Sea will be
compared to archaeological evidence in order to draw analogies between past and present foraging practices, as well as possible
consequences of environmental change on the quality and availability of these resources.
