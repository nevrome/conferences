was undertaken by a team of professional archaeologists and volunteers. A non-invasive community archaeology approach,
centring events and presentations on the land and in the local gathering places, helped build local awareness of individual sites
forming part of a whole settlement and encouraged interaction with the project. Fieldwalking, Geophysics, LiDAR analysis and
documentary research fed into the resulting report and publication. The discoveries include hints of the medieval borough’s
origins combined with further evidence of its layout, enriching state records with new information on many of the known sites
within the settlement as well as newly discovered sites and artefacts. Our understanding of the community’s views of the settlement developed over time as did their thoughts on archaeology in relation to their daily lives.
However, our ultimate aim of contributing to preservation of the archaeology through connecting rural residents and landowners
with their local heritage met challenges both during and after the project’s lifespan. Working farms adapt to new regulations and
a competitive market while generations of rural families wish to build new homes on their ancestral land. Both may impact on
known archaeological remains and those just in the process of being discovered and recorded.
Finally, ideas for preserving the borough of Old Ross while working with this rural community in Ireland are presented.
