populations living in Nubia and Central Sudan during the first four centuries of the Common Era developed a unique textile style.
Immediately recognizable, the textiles are most famous for their extensive use of cotton fiber and blue decorations in tapestry
and embroidery, displaying a blend of patterns from pharaonic, Kushite and Hellenistic heritage.
This presentation offers new insights in this unique textile tradition, using methods of both the natural sciences and the Humanities. It focuses on the iconic blue textiles, firstly by detailing the raw material and the techniques used for dyeing fibres, and secondly by exploring the symbolism of the color blue in the sartorial display of the ancient Meroitic populations. High performance
liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry was applied for the identification of dyes on well preserved funerary textiles
from Karanog. The results achieved from chemical analysis allowed to describe the importance of blue dyes and textiles in the
construction of the Meroitic eliteâ€™s wardrobe, replacing this textile production within the greater context of fashion and power
along the Nile Valley and in Sahelian Africa.
