larger and heavier than linseeds from flax plants intended for textile production.
Various archaeobotanical studies of ancient linseeds were able to identify for which purpose Linum usitatissimum L. was cultivated with the help of measuring length and width of the seeds. Yet, carbonization of archaeobotanical macro remains often
result in shrinking and deformation of the seeds and limits the meaningfulness of morphometric analyses.
Tel Burna is located about 30 km southwest of Jerusalem and dates to the Late Bronze and Iron Age. Linseeds have been found
at the site in several contexts. Evidence for weaving (clusters of loom weights) found within the city’s fortification walls, may
point towards the cultivation of flax for linen production. Excavations in the summer of 2018 concentrating on early Iron Age
strata (1200 – 975 BCE) outside the fortification wall, exposed an area of destruction revealing hundreds of charred linseeds
in proximity to complete storage vessels. The carbonized linseed finds from Tel Burna will provide the basis for establishing a
method to distinguish if archaeobotanical macro remains are residues of flax cultivation intended for oil or for textile production.
