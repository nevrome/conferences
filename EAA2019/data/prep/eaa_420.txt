Presentation Format: Oral
X-ray fluorescence is a known non-destructive technique for the investigation of various historical objects. On textiles, it might
be used to analyze the element composition of metal threads based on single point measurements with spot sizes ranging from
a few mm to less than 0.1 mm. The development of portable instrumentation a decade or more ago, brought further opportunities
