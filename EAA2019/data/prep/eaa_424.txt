Presentation Format: Oral
The prehistoric settlement on Koukonisi, an elliptical (c. 500 m x 400 m) low (max. ht. 10.6 m) islet located in the innermost part
of Moudros bay on Lemnos, was excavated under the direction of Chr. Boulotis and the auspices of the Academy of Athens from
1994 to 2016 with intermissions. The densely occupied Bronze Age settlement excavated in the north part of the islet, provides
an undisturbed sequence from the Early Bronze Age to the early Late Bronze Age, with sporadic finds of the early Mycenaean
period (LH II-LH III A1) and a substantial phase of occupation corresponding to the developed Late Bronze Age (LH III A2 - LH III B
periods). Given the fact that the loom weights begin to appear in the advanced or the close of Middle Bronze Age, I aim at discussing the introduction of the vertical loom in the settlement, an innovation which becomes more striking when evidence from earlier habitation levels is considered; the latter indicate the use of another type of loom, in all probability the horizontal one. Since
the vast majority of the loom weights brought to light, circa 40 so far, belong to the prominent South Aegean, and particularly
Cretan, type of loom-weights, with one (and rarely two) suspension holes and a peripheral groove on the top, they are considered
as one of the hallmarks (along with conical cups) of Minoan influence throughout the Aegean at the time, reflecting probably an
increased specialization in the textile industry.
