Presentation Format: Oral
While studying literature about textiles tools we found out that combs are detected in many archaeological sites throughout
time and space. The actual use of these combs is mostly linked to textile production, while the material that should be “combed”
can differ. In most cases the tools are interpreted as wool combs, only in rare cases flax combs are mentioned. From the Roman
period there are combs made of Iron from several excavations. These combs have two rows of teeth and are very large. The
combs are called “flax-combs”. We analysed the find circumstances and collected written, as well as iconographic sources about
these tools. A summary of these studies will be presented in our lecture.
In addition, we performed experiments with several artefacts like combs and brushes by using wool and flax plaits. In our lecture
we are going to present the results of these experiments and discuss the definition of the terms “flax and wool comb”.
