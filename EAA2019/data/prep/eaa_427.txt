This paper proposes to focus on several tools belonging to textile craftsmen in the Final Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age. These
discoveries from a northern half of France are the subject of a multiscalar analysis. The analysis of the weaver’s tools reconsiders the design, iconography and sometimes the function that these objects could have played. The universe thus revealed
attests to the attraction that the weaving has represented in societies in the past, both in economic terms and through symbolic
imagery. Combs, scales and spindle whorls, but also ornaments (fibulae or pins) or ceramics will be used as examples to illustrate
this point. This work aims to clarify a reflection at the level of society, by focusing on the status of the users of these objects. In
this way, we will seek to give meaning to the use of religious iconography. Rather than typological and technological aspects, a
point of view is preferred here that seeks to rediscover and interpret the ideas underlying the design of these objects and their
link with weaving. The objective is to better understand this craft and creative field, as well as its place in protohistoric society.
Ultimately, the results obtained from studies on textile production, which have recently adopted a more complex and multidis-
