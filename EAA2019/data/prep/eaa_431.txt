Due to the climate and the properties of the soil, prehistoric textiles are not preserved on the archeological sites in North Macedonia. Nevertheless, the existence of a textile industry during the Neolithic is testified by impressions of textiles in clay, as well
as by the finds of spindle whorls, loom weights and needles.
This analysis of the prehistoric textiles is based on forty impressions on fragments of ceramic vessels from eight settlements
in North Macedonia, dating from Early to the Late Neolithic. We identified the process of craftsmanship and the features of the
textiles. Weave analysis and technological classification point to only one technique, the two-thread weft twining with simple
S-twist and densely packed weft, producing a weft-faced fabric with no visible weft. The differences in the thickness of the
loosely twisted weft threads and the weft/warp ratios influence to the appearance of the textiles. The finds of ceramic and
stone loom weights indicate that some type of supported frame, perhaps a vertical warp-weighted loom was used for manufacturing those textiles, at least for the densely packed and evenly twined fabrics.
