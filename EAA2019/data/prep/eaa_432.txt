TEXTILES AND SEALS: INVESTIGATING RELATIONS BETWEEN TEXTILE PRODUCTION AND SEALS AND
SEALING PRACTICES IN BRONZE AGE GREECE USING STATISTICAL METHODS
Author(s): Ulanowska, Agata (Institute of Archaeology, University of Warsaw)
Presentation Format: Oral
The ‘Textiles and Seals’ research project investigates the multiple and complex relationships between textile production, the
iconography of seals and sealing practices in Bronze Age Greece. These relations can be traced today in the wide-ranging evidence, comprising textile imprints on the underside of and inside seal-impressed lumps of clay, seal-impressed textile tools
(especially loom weights) and textile production-related motifs in the Aegean seals imagery. The main research questions that
are posed by this project, aim to explain the use of textiles in sealing practices and the use of seals in the administration of textile
production, as well as the meaning and diachronic frequency of references to textile production that appear in the iconography
