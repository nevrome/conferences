Presentation Format: Poster
Circa 2000-1500 BC, in today’s Sudan, the Bronze Age people of Kerma knotted together long strands of linen threads to create
lattice works of elaborate designs. Used as pot nets, these ancient piece of macramé received and hang vessels from the beams
of tents and houses. 2000 years later, during the Meroitic period, similar looking lattice works decorated the bottom of cotton
textiles intended to clothe members of the elite. These openwork borders concluded the weave of large fabrics woven on the
warp-weighted loom.
In 1984 and 1998, the renowned Nubian textiles experts Elisabeth Crowfoot and Nettie Adams studied the openwork techniques developed at Kerma and at Qasr Ibrim during these two periods*. Highlighting their common decorative vocabulary, the
authors proposed to see the two techniques as different manifestations of the same crafting tradition. Twenty years later, as
part of the TexMeroe project, Elsa Yvanez and Ulrikka Mokdad reexamined this hypothesis using an interdisciplinary approach
based on the meeting of textile studies with experimental archaeology.
This poster will present their detailed study as well as their intents to reconstruct original fabric structures. Bringing heads and
hands together, the project provides the opportunity to reconstruct and understand the history and evolution of this remarkable
technique.
