In this paper I aim at examining aspects of domestic furniture in the Aegean Late Bronze Age. Starting with pertinent iconography, which provides relatively little evidence, I will focus on more or less contemporary texts, and especially on the 12 Linear B
tablets of the series Ta from Pylos. This series, which offers the most interesting information on furniture of that era, specifically
in a palatial context, constitutes a kind of inventory. It resulted from Phygegwris’ inspection of this kind of equipment on the
occasion of the designation of Augeia (au-ke-wa) as da-mo-ko-ro (see PY Ta 711.1: o-wi-de pu2-ke-qi-ri o-te wa-na-ka te-ke auke-wa), and for which au-ke-wa would have been henceforth responsible. Apart from tripods and some other metal vessels, the
main types of furniture recorded are tables (to-pe-za - cf. classical Greek τράπεζα), seats or thrones (to-no - θόρνος / θρόνος )
and stools (ta-ra-nu-we - θράνυες cf. Homeric θρήνυες ). Since all these objects belong to the treasure of the palace, the scribe is
interested in describing their decoration in details, revealing, as a consequence, a major need for display and luxury. These pieces
of evidence will be juxtaposed with archaeological finds, which not only certify the information of Linear B but also confirm the
two decoration techniques used at Pylos, i.e. engraving and inlay.
