FORMS AND FUNCTIONS OF MYCENAEAN FURNITURE
Author(s): Whittaker, Helene (University of Gothenburg)
Presentation Format: Oral
The most extensive evidence for the appearance and types of Mycenaean furniture, such as tables and chairs, can be found in
wall-paintings which depict activities that take place in indoor spaces. Terracotta figurines of seated women provide further
evidence for the types of chairs that were in use. The impression that we get from the iconographical evidence is that much
furniture was easily moveable; for example, depictions of small tables and folding chairs suggest that they would have been
stacked when not in use and that domestic space was to some extent changeable.
Although no examples of moveable furniture have been preserved, the remains of palaces and houses also provide evidence for
fixed installations such as hearths, benches, and thrones.
In this paper I present an overview of the actual evidence for Mycenaean furniture. I also discuss what the remains of houses
can tell us about the organisation of domestic space, the movements of people within the house, and how a “typical” Mycenaean
house might have been furnished.
