Around a hundred ivories of lions, sphinxes, papyrus, gazelles and bulls were discovered in the Idaean Cave, central Crete (Greece),
dating to the 9th century. They are compared to Nimrud ivories form the Loftus group and similar ones have also been found at
the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta. Some scholars think these might be imported from North Syria or Palestine, such as
Sakellarakis, but others suggest the ivory was carved in the cave.
Most of the ivory objects from the Idaean Cave would have adorned furniture, probably wooden thrones, as their screw-like
shapes and nail holes suggest. Therefore, this would have implied the presence of ivory carvers at the same site for later assembly of the wooden furniture. According to ancient sources like Philostratus, these carvers travelled to where the patron was,
in this case, Crete, to produce their work instead of selling ready-made objects (Philostratus, Vila Apollonii, 5.20). Hence, Near
Eastern ivory carvers worked in situ.
