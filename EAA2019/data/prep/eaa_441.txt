These ivories resemble the ones from Sparta, which date to later centuries. It is thought, therefore, that these ivory carvers of
Near Eastern origin that worked in Crete could have also settled in Sparta during the 7th century BC and been active there until
the 6th.
This phenomenon can shed light not only to the techniques used in Late Iron Age to produce ivory and wooden furniture, but also
to the relationships between patron and artisan, and even to the use of ancient sanctuaries not only as religious spaces but also
as production centres.
