Presentation Format: Oral
This paper will present ancient Greek beds/klinai depicted on vase- paintings. Shape, decoration and use of this furniture will be
studied focusing in selected representations on Corinthian and Attic vessels from the Archaic to the Classical times (6th â€“ 4th
c. BC). Bedclothes and pillows are also included to complete the bed-image. Sometimes footstools are displayed in front of the
bed to reach it easily and also small tables for the placement of the dishes. One or two persons are reclining or sitting on a kline
and more klinai are placed in the same room (andron) for a symposion. Depictions of klinai appear in a variety of themes. Similar
scenes in paintings from other locations, e.g. from the Greek colonies in South Italy and Sicily will be also mentioned as comparative material showing similarities and differences. References in written sources (Homer, Plato a.o.) will be compared and
combined with archaeological finds.
Aim of this paper is to classify the beds-representations according to the context in which they appear: such as in symposia
in erotic scenes, in simple daily scenes at home, such as sitting, relaxing or sleeping; in nuptial, but also in funeral rituals; in
mythological, religious or theatrical scenes. A classification according to the bed-design will also follow. It is also interesting
to examine: a) whether the bed-representations correspond with excavated finds or they used by the vase-painters only as a
painting motif representing fantastic or abbreviated versions of the real furniture; b) which vessels-forms are decorated by the
above mentioned scenes including beds.
