In 1892, the Louvre acquired the offerings of a child’s grave discovered in one of Eretria’s necropolises (on the island of Euboea
in central Greece). These offerings include more than fifty objects of different types and of various materials (bronze, silver,
lead, wood, glass, bone, terracotta) in good state of preservation. The rarity of such a funerary deposit, consisting of miniature
furniture and tableware, toiletries and daily objects, alimentary and monetary deposits, toys, as well as jewellery and terracotta
figurines, suggests that the child belonged to a rich Eretrian family. The study of this funerary material and the numismatic evidence allows us to deduce that the burial was meant for a young girl, who died during the first decades of the Hellenistic period.
The existence of five furniture forms in this tomb show the exceptional testimony of Eretrian funerary rituals of this period and
the importance of these near the dead girl to reconstruct the context of the house.
