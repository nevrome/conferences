Critical details: Examining elements on thrones and klinae from northern Greek tombs. Aspects of furniture technology of the
Greeks.
The paper focuses on funerary furniture found in early Hellenistic cist or chamber tombs in Northern Greece. Macedonia was
reputed for its abundant and top quality timber, but due to the lack of preserved wooden furniture, the furniture technology of
this area and of this era has not been studied. However, funerary furniture made of marble and stuccoed limestone replicate
wooden furniture of their time, as known to us mainly from the art and from their preserved decorative elements made of various
materials (gold, silver, ivory, and glass). Study of their details leads to conclusions about manufactural aspects of their wooden
models and to the interpretation of typical morphological features, which have remained consistent over centuries. The high level of manufacture is noted ensuring that these funerary items of furniture reflect wooden ones that were of the highest quality
of their time.
