While recent international publications have shed new light on the study of Macedonian and Anatolian furniture in funerary contexts (e.g. Andrianou 2009; Baughan 2013), new discoveries and studies in present-day Bulgaria make a first classification of
Thracian funerary furniture possible. Our paper focuses on furniture elements, which are displayed within chamber tombs in
earthern-burial mounds (e.g. Filipovo Tomb, Plovdiv; Tomb in the Griffins Tumulus, Shipka; Tomb at Dolno Izvorovo, Tomb in Ostrusha Tumulus, Shipka). They include funerary couches (klinai), tables, four-leg stools (diphroi), thrones, and foot-stools. Questions
related to typology, decoration, and production will be explored which will also provide new data to assess the chronology of
these items themselves, and of the tombs more generally. Further insights into Thracian furniture in the early Hellenistic period
offer, in addition, the analysis of furniture elements and their textile textures which are vividly sketched on the tombsâ€™ wall painting decoration (e.g. the Kazanluk tomb), as well as their description in literary sources.
