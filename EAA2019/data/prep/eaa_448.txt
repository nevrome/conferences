The iconography of reliefs depicting banquets provides a great body of evidence for furnished interiors in the Hellenistic period,
making up for their absence in the archaeological record. These reliefs (funerary or votive) present a standard iconography: one
or more males recline on a couch while one or two females sit on separate chairs on either side of the kline. In front of the kline,
a table is usually laden with food. The scene is often interspersed with exceptional furniture pieces, such as kylikeia. Banquet
reliefs thus demonstrate furniture styles and modes of entertainment between the third century BC and the first century AD.
A variety of furniture, often decorated with textiles, appear in banquet reliefs from the eastern Mediterranean (Asia Minor, southern Thrace and the East Aegean islands). Their deliberate selection and placement within the relief displays wealth and, consequently, status. Furniture becomes a visual indicator of wellbeing. Moreover the detailed depiction of furniture on reliefs engaged
the viewer in “active viewing”; as we know from textual evidence, people looked at art and discussed it amongst themselves.
Since funerary banquet reliefs extend beyond the Hellenistic era, the depiction of contemporary furniture pieces on them is
also an indicator of robust societies. Already in first-century BC Samos, the once vivid and detailed depictions of furniture become schematic objects in the background, conceding their place to the human figures. This observed shift on Samos is tightly
connected to social changes noted in Samian civic centers brought about by the First Mithridatic War and the plundering of the
island by pirates (84 BC) and by Licinius Verres (80 BC).
