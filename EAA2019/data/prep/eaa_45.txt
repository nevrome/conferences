However, the links between Thrace and Northwest Asia Minor are not equally intense in all periods. Like in the chalkolitic period, a
significant proximity can be observed towards the end of the Bronze Age (see Aslan et al. 2014, 204). The ceramic findings lead
Hnila (2012, 214-216) to assume the immigration of new populations from Thrace for Troy VIIb2. Though the detailed interpretation of the findings points to a complex scenario, this analysis seems to be widely accepted (see Grave et al. 2013).
The paper starts at this point. It wants to augment the archaeological findings on the Thracian-Anatolian contacts with findings
from other disciplines as follows:
•
Linguistics has recently gained a more precise picture of prehistoric migrations (see Anthony/Ringe 2015). The linguistic prehistory of Thrace has also been illuminated by new finds from the first pre-Christian millennium (see Brixhe/
Panayotou 1994; Brixhe 2006).
•
Archaeogenetics is now able to precisely trace the development of populations in Europe and Asia Minor into the late
Bronze Age (see Allentoft et al 2015; Haak 2015; Kristiansen 2017).
The interdisciplinary combination of the available information should lead to new scenarios and sketch the environment of prehistoric Northwest Asia Minor more clearly than hitherto possible.
