TOOL MARK LEFT ON ANCIENT TIMBER
Author(s): Killen, Geoffrey (Independent researcher)
Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation and demonstration will examine the development of metal woodwork tools and measuring equipment used in
the ancient world. From ancient Egypt we have evidence of the wide range of tools and technologies available to the ancient carpenter to furnish homes within urban settlements. Various social mechanisms were employed to source furniture and the carpenter was pivotal to the success of a settlement. The carpenter’s role was to create many of the products that made life in an
ancient Egyptian home “comfortable” or at least “tolerable”. He also helped create the fabric of houses as well as the looms and
ancillary equipment needed for home weaving. He manufactured furniture including cosmetic boxes and even had time to make
simple toys and games that Egyptians used to occupy their “leisure” time. The demonstration involves a range of copper and
bronze tools to work timber and looks at the types of tool marks these ancient tools leave on the surface of the wood. The woodworking tools discussed and evaluated will include the mortise and firmer chisel, mallet, awl, hand adze, hand saw and bowdrill.
