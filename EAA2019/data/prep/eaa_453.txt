For the Danish Late Mesolithic, it is well known that highly productive sea areas played an important role for the subsistence
together with a number of land resources. However, there has been little focus on, how such land-sea territories were organized
spatially. An analysis of the available data demonstrates a reality that differs from the general assumption, that the settlements
to a high degree were concentrated at the mouths of inlets, fjords and rivers. Settlements appear all the way around such inlets,
also at their heads. Surprisingly enough, however, the known Late Mesolithic graves show a clear tendency to concentrate at
their mouths. On the basis of these data in combination with ethnoarchaeological information about territoriality and the placing
of graves in the landscape, this situation is interpreted. It is suggested that the Late Mesolithic territoriality had a specific and
repeated pattern for the integration of sea and land areas.
