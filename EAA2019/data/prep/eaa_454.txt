Recent discourse on the relationship between society and the world-view of its members has shown that interpretation should
not be attempted solely through consideration of artificial constructions; it also needs to involve the natural landscapes
The role of wetlands as a place of contact with the spiritual world was clearly important during the Neolithic of Southern Scandinavia. In order to obtain a more detailed and hopefully more holistic understanding of votive deposition in Neolithic society,
an area in the southernmost part of Sweden was chosen for further study. The area contains a complex range of landscape
features, the understanding of which is fundamental to the analysis of wetland depositions. The landscape is mainly undulating
and the wetlands are usually rather small in size. Field survey along with information gained from several farm collections means
that the find locations of a considerable number of archaeological deposits are now known. From the perspective of the Neolithic
period, almost every wetland was used for some form of votive deposition. In certain respects, the cosmology related to wetland
offerings was active throughout most of the Neolithic, and also in later periods. Some wetlands appear to have been imbued with
ideas of a sacred character over many centuries, and in some cases millennia. Votive depositions within the hummocky landscape are usually rather small-scale, with the more substantial depositions being found in the larger wetlands on the plain. This
might indicate that wetlands in different kinds of landscapes could have special importance in the metaphysical world.
