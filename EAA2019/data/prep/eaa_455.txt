STILL POINTS IN A MOVING WORLD: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE NON-VISUAL CULTURAL MARKER
Author(s): Stevens, Fay (University of Notre Dame in England)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper focuses its attention on the deposition of Bronze Age metalwork in watery contexts of south west Britain, UK. It will
present the data of material evidence of Bronze Age metalwork, classified as ‘stray finds’, and consider patterns of depositional
practice in a variety of watery contexts. It will also take a closer look at definitions and qualities of water and consider an interplay
between the materiality of metal and its relationship to specific water types. This will lead to a deeper discussion on phenomenological fieldwork methodologies and how we might approach a study of findspots and waterscapes. These still points in the
moving worlds of the Bronze Age offer a great insight into cultural acts of deposition and the construction of liquidscapes. This
evidence has much to offer in our understanding of the Bronze Age and this paper will present a proposition for an archaeological
engagement with water/liquidscapes of non-visual social action.
