A SURROUNDED SEA: THE IRISH SEA AS LANDSCAPE OR SEASCAPE DURING THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD
Author(s): Johnson, Andrew (Manx National Heritage)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Isle of Man lies close to the centre of the Irish Sea, surrounded by what is now Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. The
earlier medieval religious landscape of the island is characterised by small chapels, burial grounds and associated monuments,
particularly carved stone crosses. About 170 chapels and more than 200 crosses are known, within an island of just 580km².
Previous research has tended to focus on the distribution of these monuments within the island’s landscape, but little attention
has been paid to the relationship of those sites lying on the coast or those with views to neighbouring landmasses.
The application of map-regression and landscape survey is beginning to make sense of the factors governing the siting of these
monuments, their perspective when viewed from the sea, and the links they potentially create across an enclosed seascape.
This offers new ways of appreciating the Irish Sea as an ‘inland’ sea, and the opportunities it presented for travel, communications, trade and pilgrimage during the medieval period.
