Like the Mediterranean Sea in miniature, the Trondheimsfjord is situated in central Norway, widening from a narrow inlet to a
width of 13 km and stretching 130 km into the inland, structured by branches, islands and estuaries. Touching at a right angle
the seaborne trading route along the coastline of Atlantic Norway, the inlet is also connected to central Sweden by large eastwest going valleys, thus constituting an important junction for long-distance traffic. The lowlands south and east of the fjord are
among the best agricultural areas in Norway. Centrally in the fjord and easily accessible by water from all directions, the superior
court site Frostatinget was situated on the Frosta-peninsula. Scattered around the fjord, at estuaries and in the agricultural
areas, chieftain seats from the Viking Age are documented by archaeological and written sources. Depending on their position
as well as the size and quality of their hinterland, their access to infield and outfield resources was different, as well as access to
communication networks. Separated from each other by wooded areas and highlands, these settlement chambers were hardly
connected by overland routes. On the contrary they were closely connected by water, supported by the advanced ship-building
technology of the Viking Age which offered excellent conditions for water-bound traffic. The medieval Icelandic sources refer to
a number of powerful and well communicating Viking chieftains in the areas within the Trondheimsfjord. Strong chieftain seats,
