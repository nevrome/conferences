Wetland archaeology put emphasis on the waterscapes and the societies that dwelled and interacted with such environment.
This approach provided very detailed insight into the life of prehistoric communities inhabiting the lakes and marshes i.e. the
natural setting that enabled good preservation of organic material, such as buildings, tools, effigies, baskets, clothes etc. The
abundance of this material opened new perspectives of archaeological research and integrated more the science in setting
the thorough answers on how people lived in the past and when in particular the chronological events had happen. But on the
other hand, this fertile scientific milieu of wetland archaeology disregarded what was going on in the neighboring dryland areas
and sort of isolated the lacustrine and marshland societies from the potential interface they had with people living in different
environment.
Therefore a refocus of wetland archaeology is necessary, first on reconsideration of landscapes that were once marshes or
shallow lakes and recently were modified into drylands, and second, the reassessment of networks lacustrine societies had with
communities living far from them or in a nowadays altered environment. Such reevaluation has been applied recently to Neolithic
societies in the Balkans that exposed a dynamic networking of distant societies living on lakeshores and valleys behind high
mountains, but also indicated different landscape from the one we can observe today. Therefore this paper will aim to employ
the same approach and consider the lacustrine societies and those in distant valleys in Chalcolithic, Bronze and Iron Age in the
Balkans. Current data indicates much more lively interaction in these final stages of prehistory even among communities living
thousand kilometers away and in the different environmental settings.
