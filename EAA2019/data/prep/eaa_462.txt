In addition to the results from the surveys and the excavations, the presentation addresses the archaeological material and the
movable finds, such as harpoons, axes, pottery and loom weights, as well as some similarities and differences in their material,
shapes and use. All these findings will allow us connect all regional sites and use them for joint research.
These sites date from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, so one of the aims of this presentation is to understand past human behavior
and environmental dynamics in the region.
