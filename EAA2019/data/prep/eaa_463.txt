DOES IT REALLY MATTER? ASPECTS OF SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENTS
IN AMINDEON BASIN (WESTERN MACEDONIA, GREECE)

Presentation Format: Oral
The fragmentary view of the prehistoric habitation in Amindeon Basin has changed rapidly the last few years due to the preventive archaeological work of Florina Ephorate of Antiquities (Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports), imposed by the intensified
mining activities at Amindeon Lignite Mining Zone. The Rescue Excavations Project was initially focused on the survey and trial
trenching of an area of approximately 550 hectares, an endeavor that resulted the discovery of 54 new archaeological sites
dating from prehistoric times to late antiquity.
The dominant presence of the basin’s four lakes constituted one distinctive natural setting, in which the Neolithic and Bronze
Age inhabitants performed their socioeconomic and ideological activities. However, beyond the “strategic” decision of the local
communities to operate diachronically in a wetland environment, the specific locations chosen for the establishment of the
occupations show recordable diversity in respect to their spatial relationship to water. Consequently, the shift of structures,
people, livestock and activities from water- to landscapes and vice versa necessitates some focused reconsideration of the
characterizations “lakeshore”, “lakeside” or “dry-land” which are frequently used to describe the prehistoric settlements discovered in Amindeon Basin.
In order to approach this issue, some of the results emerged from the rescue excavations of the prehistoric settlements
Anarghiri IXa, IXb and XI will be presented. The information regarding their location at the surroundings of Lake Chimaditis, their
spatial proximity, dating and diachronic development form the general framework for their first-level integration into the local
environmental and sociocultural context. Moreover, the architectural remains and especially the accessing and enclosing works
unearthed at the periphery of the settlements offer - due to their size, structural attributes and spatial arrangement - intriguing
evidence regarding the spatiotemporal interactions of the local prehistoric communities in the fluid water- and landscapes of
Amindeon Basin.
