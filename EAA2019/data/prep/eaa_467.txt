Presentation Format: Oral
Connecting different parts of the landscape divided by water has always been a human occupation, with our present efforts
little changed in form from those in the past – going around, going through, going on, and going over. While today monumental
bridges often dominate the landscape, in European pre- and proto-history there are relatively few examples of bridges, much
less monumental constructions. Recent developer-funded excavations at the site of Pont-sur-Seine in north-eastern France
provide us with a new data that allows us to imagine that bridges were more common, and in some cases more monumental, than
we thought.
Our work at the site identified five bridges, comprised of nearly 350 in situ posts, with construction and reconstruction dating
between 215/213BC and 134/133 BC. These bridges also existed within and an already occupied landscape, with a large neolithic settlements to the immediate north and east, and a bronze age habitat occupying a small island within the channel which
the bridges cross, illustrating that this location in the wider landscape was well inscribed into the collective memory of the Iron
Age bridge builders.
Crossing relatively long spans of up to 80m, and built to a height least 4 to 5m above the bed of the Seine, the bridges themselves
were built and repaired according to a relatively standard model, while also taking into account the visible, invisible, occupied,
and perhaps ‘spiritual’, nature of the Seine at this particular point in the landscape (an exceptional statue, likely of a woman and
made from Yew, was recovered near the base of one of the bridges). It is also clear from our experience that the retrieval of this
type of data is closely related to the excavation methodology, which comprises the mechanical stripping of large surfaces and
the emptying of substantial sections of palaeo-channels.
