Of Austriaâ€™s nearly 30 waterlogged sites 22 are attributed to the 4th mil. Mondsee group. These sites lie scattered around the
lakes Attersee and Mondsee at the periphery of the Northern Limestone Alps. Together with the cultural entities of Cortaillod
and Pfyn, the Mondsee group counts among the earliest copper-using horizon north of the Alps. The rich material culture of these
