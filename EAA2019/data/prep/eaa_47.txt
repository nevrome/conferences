One of the largest challenges in archaeologically identifying ‘Luwian’ socio-political entities in Late Bronze Age Anatolia is the
close association between Luwian monumental inscriptions and Hittite hegemony. In this paper we draw together wide-ranging
data from the Konya Plain in south-central Turkey, in particular recent results of the Konya Regional Archaeological Survey Project
(KRASP), to suggest that one such socio-political entity might be located in the Konya Plain. We discuss Luwian-inscribed monuments in the orographic margins of the Plain in relation to a number of meaningful patterns in settlement and land use. These
include: 1) large-scale urbanization in the second millennium BC; 2) the proliferation of new settlements in marginal landscapes
during the Late Bronze Age; 3) the establishment of a defensive network of hilltop fortifications around the Konya Plain by the
early second millennium BC, and probably earlier.
The paper revisits the Tarhuntašša problem, but supported by these extensive regional survey data and a comparative literature
on the archaeological landscapes of early state entities. Whilst both the ‘Luwian’ identity of the Late Bronze Age inhabitants
of the Konya Plain and the identification of one or more sites with the Tarhuntašša capital remains conjectural at best, future
research of KRASP will be guided by these and related considerations.”
