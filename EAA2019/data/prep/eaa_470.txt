palaeoenvironmental investigations with a landscape approach. Here we propose to present our landscape archaeology work in
the Mondsee-Attersee region.
Firstly we investigated the lacustrine settlements on the shores of lakes Attersee and Mondsee by means of site catchment
analysis on different surfaces of a high resolution terrain model. A broad variety of open source landscape data was included in
the analysis. Based on this a predictive model for the shore areas of lakes Attersee and Mondsee was developed. Secondly we
aimed at enhancing our understanding of the relationship between the lakeshore areas and the dryland zones in the hinterland
of the lakes through the investigation of visual patterns, cost surface analysis and various other forms of landscape characterization. One of the most remarkable results of these analysis is the distinct character of 4th millenium “visibility patterns”
compared to other time periods.
