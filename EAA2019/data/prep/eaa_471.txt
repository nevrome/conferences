ELEMENTS OF AN AQUATIC CULTURAL LANDSCAPE

Underwater and wetland archaeology have made important contributions to the knowledge of the origins and development of
“cultural landscapes”. In spite of that the perspective to “landscape” has basically remained terrestrial. Scientific questions and
ongoing debates focus mainly on land-based subsistence strategies like woodland management, land use or agricultural operation systems. This is in a certain contrast to the nature of waterlogged sources, which include a multitude of features illustrating
the importance of water as a resource. Prehistoric research on “pile dwellings” all across Europe has yielded a large variety of
impressive evidence from lake floors and bog sites, throwing a light to the close relation of humans and wet environments. With
shorelines that changed permanently due to oscillating water tables and human activity, “landscape” expands beyond waterfronts. Modelling of geomorphological formations below today´s water tables has revealed the same close relations of archaeological sites – especially settlements - to geological and hydrological features as on dry land. In the larger scale of landscape
archaeology such “submerged landscapes” occur as elements of a cultural landscape that is composed of aquatic as well as of
dry land features. The presentation identifies basic elements of aquatic cultural landscapes from a frog´s eye perspective and
at the example of archaeological landscapes of the South West German pre-alpine forelands.
