Presentation Format: Poster
A growing corpus of finds dated to the Palaeolithic from islands in the Aegean has changed the archaeological communityâ€™s
perspective on the earliest occupation of oceanic islands and the capacity of pre-sapiens hominins to make successful sea
crossings. Some scholars have chosen to relate these marine dispersals with ancestral species such as Homo erectus or Homo
heidelbergensis. This data has been compared with evidence of Pleistocene seafaring from the Pacific Ocean, as well as proposed sea-crossings of the Atlantic Ocean. Although the correlation of local finds with global perspectives of the past can and
has been fruitful in many cases, the marine-route hominin dispersals theory in the Mediterranean has not thus far been well
documented based more on inference rather than direct evidence. The majority of scholars deem the existing evidence, mainly
from the Aegean, insufficient to support systematic sea faring activities on the Mediterranean or a sustained hominin presence
on the Greek islands. The suggestion that a non-modern species, such Homo erectus, had inhabited islands in the Aegean or the
Pacific during the Lower Palaeolithic is difficult to prove on the existing corpus of evidence, however it may equally be difficult to
disprove. The debate has led both sides to extreme views, ultimately offering little to the better understanding of human mobility
and modern behaviour during the Pleistocene. An alternative approach to the idea of early seaward dispersals will be discussed,
interpreting local data based on the concept of glocalisation.
