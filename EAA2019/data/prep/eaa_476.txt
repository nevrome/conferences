Austria’s Monuments Authority (BDA) is a federal institution with a statutory mandate to catalogue Austria’s monuments. The
Authority is working on georeferenced mapping of this inventory in context with Austria’s offensive towards more digitalization. Austria’s administrative procedure for example in process of monument protection includes a mandatory identification of
objects via political community, cadastral community and lot. Exact identification is obligatory, as this is a procedure for each
individual object. In order to comply with legal obligations on the basis of INSPIRE the Authority has to provide mapping of all objects – archaeological and other – accessible by the public via cooperation with State authorities enables for easy access to this
geo data, that facilitates a simplification in administrative procedure. Casefiles are presented, that highlight the benefit for the
Authority on the one hand and the public, for example land owner, developer or planning commissions as the data provided by the
Authority create a better understanding and better knowledge on exact locations of archaeological monuments.
