The Amersfoort Agenda encourages actors in archaeology from all over Europe to start sharing archaeological information. Yet
to be able to share any data with new technologies, this data needs to exist digitally. For this critical first step, a case study is
presented that discusses an approach enabling digital access to the archaeological data of the canton Grisons, Switzerland.
The archaeological service of Grisons has recently started to use digital documentation techniques on excavations. Thus, from
the past couple of years there is a rich collection of spatial information that is joinable to an existing archaeological database.
However, most records of the archaeological work – starting at the end of the 19th century – only exist in analogue form. To
optimize planning processes and to stimulate research questions, it is crucial to allow digital access to basic information of all
known 3500 archaeological sites - spanning from Palaeolithic stone tools to defence structures of the First World War. In order
to create a digital inventory, it was necessary to define standards for archaeological as well as spatial data. Based upon these,
