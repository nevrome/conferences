the project ”Bestandesaufnahme Kulturgut” was started to transfer site-specific information of analogue archives to the digital
database. Reviewed coordinates are displayed in a GIS-Service as point features along with polygons for sites with a spatial
extent. For the operational management of archaeological sites the ultimate aim is to provide a platform that allows a quick
assessment of the local situation when working on applications for planning permissions. Along the way, choices concerning the
standards and the selection of sites had to be made constantly. In regard to the question of public access to this data, it will be
essential to balance the gain of open data with the potential risks involved.
