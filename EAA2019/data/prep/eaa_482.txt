with other institutions. It will also critique the fundamental limitations when operating in a competitive tendering environment
and the possible ways of addressing fragmentation and competitiveness. In particular it will address the impact of local authorities and government bodies in recommended data capturing methodologies and their adoption or not by commercial units.
This presentation will be based on personal working experience during the last 10 years in the UK and from different posts and
organisations. It will be a personal journey on the fundamental change digital data capture has brought to our field drawing examples from large scale projects, collaborations among companies and institutions.
In addition, this paper will compare data capture and analysis on a company level, company collaboration level and the role of
non-commercial institutions in providing a consensus and common standards.
