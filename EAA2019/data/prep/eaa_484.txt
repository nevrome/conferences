Format: Regular session
Colonial perspectives have dictated many areas of interpretation within the fields of Archaeology, Anthropology and History
since their inception, influencing discourse, terminology and approaches to past and present communities. This perspective
has created imbalances of power between cultures but also between the researcher and ‘the researched’. In recent years, many
voices have emerged which stress the need to question this Western European mainstream discourse, and instead explore
other dynamics and models of thinking which enrich our understandings of societies, rather than continuing to perpetuate colonialist understandings.
Focusing on the concept of space, this session aims to discuss the multitude of ways to ‘be in space’ around the world and
through time, adopting a critical stance to the dominant Cartesian logic. The session welcomes methodologies developed to
explore understandings of space, alongside topics related to: the understanding and conceptualisation of space, relationships
between time-space and kinship-space, local concepts of space, local geographies, social landscapes, spatial materiality, and
textual or pictorial depictions of geographies. These topics are by no means exhaustive, and innovative proposals which are
related to the decolonisation of space in ways we have not mentioned are more than welcome.
