Archeological studies regarding pre-Hispanic mechanisms of environment appropriation have been crucial to explain the complexity of Mesoamerican societies. However, an ontological dichotomy of water and land has permeated these investigations for
decades. The activities practiced on the mainland, such as agriculture, among many others, are the preferred focus of interest
for explaining indigenous social and historical processes. The activities and the role of the aquatic spaces are generally considered subordinate or secondary concerning the former. Through archaeological, iconographic and historical evidence this paper
argues that Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec, had a perception of the environment in which, although
water was of course distinguished from the mainland, it was not seen exclusively as an opposite space, liminal and independent to the political, social, economic and religious dynamics of the indigenous people. Evidence of this is the development of a
complex nautical technology that was permeated by the religious and ideological configurations of the societies that produced
it. Consequently, navigation was practiced as a landscape connectivity system that integrated the use of waterways, coastal
lagoons, wetlands, and estuaries, along with roads and activities in the mainland. This study allows for rethinking the valuation of
aquatic spaces and getting closer to the local perception of the environment, in which the aquatic spaces are no longer the limit
of the territories inhabited by humans.
