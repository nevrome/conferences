Somewhat relieved the foreign professors returned to me and repeated their concerns like a mantra: ”There is no place in the world similar to Apollonia.” Their concern was based on the fact that
Apollonia’s architecture is difficult to compare to that of any other cities in the region or elsewhere, and hence an impossibility to
translate it and reach exhaustive conclusions on it.
Thus, this presentation focuses on ways to decolonise Albanian archaeology away from Soviet frameworks and to engrave new
engagement spaces with the materiality of the Illyrian urban period in present-day Albanian territories, aware of the need to
move forward with the analytical tools provided by ontology relying on new materialism without any predefined frameworks and
vectors.
This is not to reinforce claims that the proposal to consider the possibility of engaging with relational ontology is the latest fashion that dictates how things operate in a given situation (Alberti et al 2011, 910).
In this paper, focusing on the development and demise of Illyrian cities, I demonstrate that ontology in archaeology presents
the opportunity for producing conditions, such as theory, materials, past, new ones that change. According to Alberti, ontology
