DIGGING FOR THE DICTATOR: HISTORICIZING EXCAVATION SITES
Author(s): Wirth, Christa (University of Agder)
Presentation Format: Oral
In this paper, I will discuss the excavation site as a space that needs to be historicized. By means of historical-critical analysis, I
will look at archaeological sites in the post-World War Two period in the Philippines. In this time excavation sites in the Philippines
became locations of great public resonance as they provided Philippine society access to a history that was untouched by the
Spanish and U.S. Empires that colonized the Philippines for 350 years. The Philippines did not become independent until 1946.
The excavation sites, as I will argue, became national landmarks where decolonization took place. However, U.S. influence and
anxieties over the spread of communism in Asia, and Philippine nationalist efforts resulted in archaeologists providing ideological support for Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship. The excavation sites became symbols of Marcos’ power. Thus, the interpretation
of the excavation site as contested space unfolds at the nexus of decolonization, nationalism, and the Cold War.
