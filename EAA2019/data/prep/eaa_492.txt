Presentation Format: Poster
The study of the landscape of the inner Iberia during the Calcolithic period has never been a priority in previous studies, let alone
its importance in the appearance of the Bell Beaker phenomenon among the Copper Age societies. Through spatial analysis we
could reinterpret the relationship between these societies and the landscape, getting to know better their idiosyncrasies and
the nature of the observed phenomena inside them. The present work shows the preliminary results of the landscape analysis
that is being carried out currently in the Bell Beaker sites of the territory included in the Henaresâ€™ upper basin (Guadalajara, Spain)
and Ambrona Valley (Soria, Spain). In doing so, we intend to deconstruct the phenomenon and get better knowledge about the
structure that underlies it. Mobility, relationships between groups and the exploitation of critical resources could be important
keys to help comprehend how those people perceived the physical space, creating a landscape that can only be understood
through such a detailed study.
