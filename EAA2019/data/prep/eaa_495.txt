diagnosis of specific diseases in the reconstruction of a society’s health and care, even if healthcare in past populations is still
rarely assessed.
To approach health and healthcare from a dental anthropological approach is even more difficult. We know that as teeth develop
throughout an individual’s life, different nutritional and physiological disturbances are affecting health from childhood, leave permanent traces on teeth. Consequently, the assessment of dental markers, pathologies, and biochemical analysis of dental tissues provides insights into the episodes of disruption, pathological susceptibility and epidemiological events that a population
endures over a specific period. New microscopic methodological approaches are nowadays making it possible to improve the
accuracy of applied techniques and results, pushing forward previous analytical limitations, particularly our research questions
focused on people’s daily lives and healthcare in the past.
