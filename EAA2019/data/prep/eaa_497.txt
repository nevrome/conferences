This paper will discuss the results of our research, which focuses on understanding the lives of pre-Dogon and early Dogon
people in central Mali during the 7th and 19th c. AD. We have studied a large sample of skeletal remains of individuals from the
collective burial caves of the Bandiagara Escarpment. 220 dentitions were examined for signs of disease and wear, carbon and
nitrogen isotopes were measured on 175 bulk dentine samples, while a sub-set of teeth (n = 39) with incremental δ13C and δ15N
data reveal further information at an individual level. In addition, 41 teeth are being analysed for palaeo-microbiology in order to
search for microorganisms, including Yersinia pestis, which may have afflicted these prehistoric societies. So far, 86 AMS radiocarbon dates allow us to establish a new chronology for the funerary practices.
Our isotope results shed light on the temporal evolution of diet between pre-Dogon and Dogon periods, and a geographic distinction in foodways at the southern and northern ends of the Escarpment. Furthermore, inter-site differences demonstrate
that communities were disposing of their dead in different caves. Consistent with previous archaeological and ethnographic
evidence, these results attest to a complex history of settlement and foodways.
Intra-individual isotopic shifts in δ15N and δ13C indicate great diversity in personal experiences pointing to differences in nutritional and health status. These results also provide information on some important milestones for these past communities, such
as breastfeeding, weaning, childhood foraging, pregnancy and habitat change related to marriage.
