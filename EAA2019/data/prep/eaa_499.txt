tity in Bronze Age burial grounds. Our study is based on osteological samples collected from important burial grounds of this period (inhumation and cremation graves): Luduş-Fabrica de Cânepă (Romania), Carei-Bobald (Romania), Sebeş-Între răstoace (Romania), Törökszentmiklós-Kengyeltenyősziget (Hungary). Beside morpho-taxonomical analysis, our investigations implied two
further different methods in collaboration with the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of Târgu Mureş:
biochemical investigations (analysis of dental calculus: level of oxalate, phosphate, carbohydrates in dental plaque, microscopic
structure of the calculus) and dental morphological analysis (2D image analysis) in order to identify connection between health
status and dental diseases.
With biochemical and mesoscopic analysis of the teeth we intend to identify marks of lifestyle and dietary differences/transformations in graves with or without metal objects.
The present paper aims to present health status and dietary differences in micro-regional communities from the Eastern Carpathian Basin.
