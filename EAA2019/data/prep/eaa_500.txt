Dental pathological indicators have been used for a long time in order to infer health status in archaeological collections. These
indicators include the presence of cavities, dental plaque, periodontal disease, or the presence of enamel hypoplasias. It has
been suggested that due to the inclusion of a diet rich in carbohydrates during the Neolithic, the health status of the individuals
and the populations got worse. This has mainly been suggested by the increase in the observed prevalence of cavities in this. In
this work, we present the results of dental pathologies and isotope data of nearly 500 Neolithic individuals from the northeast
of the Iberian Peninsula. We show the relations between different pathological indicators and their relationship with the dietary
proxy. We have analysed these variants using multivariate statistics. Therefore, we aim to determine whether the presence of
certain pathologies is related, and also whether fluctuations in the diet component may affect the presence of concrete pathological indicators.
