Presentation Format: Oral
Dental and oral status is a valuable indicator of health, diet, and lifestyle of past populations. The assessment and diagnosis of
oral pathologies has improved through advances in microscopy for external surface observations and high-resolution medical
imaging equipment (cone beam computed tomography [CBCT] and microcomputed tomography [microCT]) for internal/virtual
observations. However, some of these advances are not only expensive but also time-consuming and not always accessible,
thus limiting their applicability for scoring dental pathologies of large burial assemblages.
The aim of this contribution is to assess suitability of several high-resolution imaging methodologies (microCT, CBCT, scanning
