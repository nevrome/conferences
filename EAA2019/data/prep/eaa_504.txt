Pulp stones or denticles are small nodular hard tissue bodies which can occur single or multiple in the dental pulp, and may interfere with access to the root canal during endodontic therapy. In clinical diagnostic the prevalence of pulp stones is underestimated, though incidences may vary significantly. This variability can be explained methodologically (digital volume tomography) but
population-specific differences could play a major role, too. Moreover, etiologically links to trauma, dietary effects or even cardiovascular diseases are discussed. Thus, pulp stones represent very interesting structures for palaeopathological issues. The
evidence in archaeological skeletal remains can be significant, especially in connection with pathological findings and dietary
reconstruction. In the present study, skeletal finds from the Neolithic and modern times excavated in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany,
were examined for the presence of pulp stones using digital volume tomography (DVT) images. It was analysed whether the
development of pulp stones can be correlated with ageing, dental wear, dental pathologies, and dietary habits. This contribution
presents preliminary results.
