The Viking Age town Birka (Sweden) has provided a rich corpus of archaeological textiles and tools for textile production. Though
fragmentary in character, the multitude of finds and their contexts convey many aspects of production, import and use as reflected through the settlement and the graves. There is however a context in which the use of textiles remains relatively unknown, namely Birkaâ€™s garrison. Enclosed by ramparts and palisades, the garrison incorporated a great hall, as well as economy
buildings and workshops. Evidence suggests that textiles were produced in the workshop area, while inside the hall weapons
wrapped in textile were stored in locked cases along the walls. storytelling. How was the hall furnished and how was it perceived
by the people moving in the interior? Although the archaeological material is limited, this paper aims to explore the possible uses
of textiles in this martial environment, from practical purposes such as bed linen and wall insulation to storytelling and preservers of collective myths.
