LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION OF HOUSEHOLD TEXTILES IN NORTHERN JUTLAND OR SOMETHING
ELSE?
Author(s): Sarauw, Torben (Historical Museum of Northern Jutland)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Limfjord area of Northern Jutland is characterized by numerous and large metal-rich sites dating from c. 400-1000 AD. Only
a few sites have been excavated, but still a pattern occurs when the topsoil is removed, and the archaeological traces revealed.
Thus, in the 7th and 8th centuries there was an explosive increase in the number of pithouses and often we only find a smaller
number of ordinary longhouses. One site, Bejsebakken situated at the outskirts of Aalborg, revealed more than 400 pithouses.
New analyses have shown that the major part of the pithouses were weaving or spinning huts, indicating that these buildings
were now the primary location for textile production and that some form of specialisation and standardisation had taken place
in the production. Textiles for clothing, and possibly also for shipsâ€™ sails etc. were mass produced in the Limfjord area, where
there were optimal conditions for sheep-farming and perhaps also a special maritime tradition. This presentation will discuss the
character of the production of textiles in the pithouses, but also look at the interior of the pithouse as a living and working space.
This presentation is part of the From Central Place to Urban Space-project funded by the VELUX FOUNDATION.
