In these years Sagnlandet Lejre, Denmark, is creating the 8th century royal hall excavated in the nearby village of Lejre. It is a 61
m long house, which will contain rooms such as a 300 m2 reception hall with richly adorned pillars and centrally placed high seats,
as well as the kingâ€™s bedroom. The intention is to create a living setting of a local king in the 8th century Zealand, to give an insight
to the public about life, social status and view of the world in the Early Viking Age. However, one thing is the large project of building the house, another thing is to equip it with furniture and textiles to make it look like the room a king would use to receive his
guests. Both pictures, ethnological and archaeological sources indicate that textiles has been of major importance, from richly
decorated tapestries along the walls telling significant stories, to more mundane pieces such as cushions.
In this paper, I will present some of the thoughts, ideas - and dreams - we have for this project.
