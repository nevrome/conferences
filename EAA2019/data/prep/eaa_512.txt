Based on document and microscope studies of 34D, and of a further nine bands from the Oseberg find , analysis and tests were
performed with practice weave samples in three phases. The study of yarn scraps from 34D revealed three-ply yarn in three
hues: two wool threads and one thread probably in silk. The find brought new insight into material production in the Early Viking
