Age.
In finds from the study of the nine bands, diverse techniques and patterns can be inferred, which allows a unique glimpse into
local weave tradition. The bands have geometrical motifs, a Scandinavian tradition going back to the Early Iron Age, but also plant
motifs, which is a rare occurrence in a historic tablet weave perspective. Special features in the find are closely connected to the
choice of materials and techniques. That can be seen as an expression of the artistic design of both the weaving community and
of individual weavers. Several bands are unique masterpieces, but 34D is the most varied, both in terms of motif and of weave
techniques.
