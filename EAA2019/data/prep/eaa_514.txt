Presentation Format: Oral
This paper presents results from my research project on the grave textiles from Valsgärde – an Iron Age boat cemetery in Uppland, Sweden. After a renewed analysis of the artifacts retrieved from the excavations is it now clear that the fifteen boat
graves of the site contained a larger amount of preserved textile than previously thought. In addition, based on the find materials,
it is possible to note a change in the furnishing of the burial rooms taking place around 700–800 A.D. The weapon rich interior and
bed textiles of wool and linen are replaced and instead luxurious silk with silver embroidery, clothing and furnishing with decorations of silver posament and tablet woven trims in silk and silver appear together with a smaller number of weapons and shields.
The wool and linen fragments appear now only in very small numbers as clothing and protective materials around artifacts.
In this presentation, I will mainly focus on the use of silk in the boat grave burial rooms and discuss the different types of silk that
have been identified.
