SEPARATING THE INSEPARABLE? THE MAKER AND USER OF LATER PREHISTORIC TOOLS
Author(s): Adams, Sophia (University of Glasgow; Later Prehistoric Finds Group)
Presentation Format: Oral
When recording collections of archaeological artefacts, we categorise them into familiar groups: tools, weapons, fixtures and
fittings, ornaments and so on. In so doing the implication is that the form of the object is synonymous with its function. Aside
from the issues inherent in such simplistic interpretations it also glosses over whether the object was made to be an intended
type of item and whether it was used in this way and by whom. We seem to understand the complex uses of items of weaponry
for causing injury, for display, for promoting messages of power or status or skill. But when it comes to tools, we are far less discursive on the point; except in the possibility that a tool for having an impact on an inert material could also function as a weapon
on an animate being.
In this short presentation I want to focus on the toolmakers and the making of tools for makers. I will work to my strengths and
concentrate on the metal tools and tools of metallurgy: adzes, axes chisels, crucibles, gouges, hammers, moulds, tongsâ€¦ Is
there any evidence that indicates a separation between the creator maker and the user maker? If yes is this widespread? If no,
what does that mean? Through these examples I aim to set the scene for our group discussion on the intersection of the goals
and choices of the maker and the agency of the user.
