Presentation Format: Oral
Wood rapidly perishes in archaeological contexts and the vast majority of objects made in this raw material are missing. But,
could we recover evidences of wooden recipients through the analysis of ceramics? In Northwest Iberia during Iron Age wares
are mostly composed by closed recipients that have been used for storing and cooking. Whilst open recipients such as buckets,
tankards, platters, cups, bowls and scoops used for serving and consuming food and drink are missing. These latter recipients,
as well as lids and stoppers were probably made of wood or cork and have been mostly vanished in the archaeological record. But
several of their features could be reflected on ceramics, such as techniques, surfaces, decoration and forms typical of wooden
vessels. Material choices could be related to technological innovations but also with social customs of drink and food consumption in the case of wooden recipients. A specific ceramic type has been selected to reflect on the relation established between
wood and ceramic crafts: the cylindrical ceramic vessels identified in the Miño Basin which are probably emulating stave-built
and carved containers.
