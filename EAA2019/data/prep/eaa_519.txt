SOCIAL IDEAS

Craft specialisation is an important activity and it has been the topic of much discussion among anthropologists and archaeologists. Through this activity, different types of artefact are created, each one with a particular purpose (e.g. utilitarian or luxurious) depending on social needs.
Once artefacts are produced, they circulate through the activity of the market and, finally, are consumed by users. Thus, craft
specialisation, market and consumption are intersected activities and representative of a powerful agency. The social agents
that perform these activities may be related to specific social structures such as a state and, consequently the method of
production and the use of specific artefacts may have been chosen to support socio-political strategies and to communicate
cultural values, constructing territorial and social boundaries.
The Minoan talismanic seals are a large group of homogeneous artefacts defined by shape, specific materials, engraving technique, style and chronology. This paper discusses how specific cultural and, potentially, political ideas may have been constructed through their production. The analysis emphasises the role of the craftsmen and examines how these ideas were territorially
disseminated. This study of the market and consumption of the talismanic seals raises new questions about the general political
configuration of Crete during this complex phase.
