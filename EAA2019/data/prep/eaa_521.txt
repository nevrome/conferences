cal reaffirmation or change. These raw materials have not always had the same value or meaning and this depends absolutely on
the cultural value conferred by the society that consumes them. However, it seems that ivory has always enjoyed great esteem
in the social and cultual spheres. Used in Iberian Copper Age in funerary/ritual context, it has been recurrently used as an expression of wealth and status to support strategies of social reaffirmation. We find an early example of this in the Chalcolithic site of
Valencina de la Concepción (Seville, Spain).
Valencina stands out with almost 8.8 kg of ivory, surpassing, so far, the weight of any other Iberian chalcolithic site. The main
consumption context (91% of the artifacts) is the funerary/ritual, and no tools manufactured in this material have been found.
In contrast, Valencina ivory artifacts have a close relationship with personal (beads, combs, rings, pendants) and objects ornamentation (cylindrical containers, boxes, perforated disks, handles, plates, lids, containers mouths), and except for minimum
coincidences, each tomb has a unique ”batch” of pieces. This suggests that the objects were not manufactured in serie, but
perhaps in a personalized way, oriented to a particular type of consumers (prominent people or with ambitions to stand out within
a certain society or group?).
This paper will highlight the role of ivory in the Chalcolithic site of Valencina, as a marker or social differentiator (unique pieces),
and its use (fragmentation and redistribution of pieces) as a tool to perpetuate union with the ancestors or with a previous prominent lineage, as a way of sustaining unions with other people, living or dead, and reinforce the feeling of belonging or identity.
