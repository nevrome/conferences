Presentation Format: Oral
The discovery of numerous new ‘Arras’ square barrow burials at the edge of the Yorkshire Wolds in the UK has renewed interest in this chariot-loving community who buried their dead with great icons of British ‘Celtic’ art – swords, shields, necklaces
and mirrors. Here we present the story of three small brooches: composites of bronze and iron, with red glass and coral beads.
Uniquely, these brooches bear moulded or pinned elements which create characterful zoomorphic faces and bodies. In order to
make sense of these diminutive, charming yet symbolically powerful objects, this paper reports on the reproduction of three
replicas… a collaboration between archaeologists, smiths, glassworkers, osteologists and faunal experts. By discussing not
only their making but wearing and handling, we hope to conjure something of Stuart Piggott’s evocation of the ‘exuberance of
sheer pleasure in elegance’ (1992: 68) in the smallest of well-crafted objects, and how this played a particular importance in their
final role as grave goods and shroud pins.
