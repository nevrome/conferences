GOLDEN IMITATIONS OF ROMAN COINS – SYMBOLS OF POWER?

Like many other products, Roman coins were exported far beyond of the borders of the Roman Empire. There they entered a new
sphere of economic and social interactions. Later they were also imitated in significant numbers. Until the mid-3rd century primarily silver denarii were copied, which remained in a primarily economic sphere of economic transactions. Later, gold coins were
also imitated and were to a large extent removed from the monetary sphere.
I am studying the imitations of Roman coins from “the Central European barbaricum” between the 4th and 6th centuries A.D.
with a focus on imitations in gold. The majority of these imitations were directly removed from monetary circulation by piercing
or looping – or in some cases produced in this way – and thus never went into monetary circulation, suggesting that these pieces
took on a whole new meaning. Comparable to jewellery, these coins could be worn on the body, on clothing as part of the costume
or as decoration on weapons and equipment, whereby the possible symbolic significance for the wearer or wearers and the
effect on the outside should not be underestimated. For in almost all cases the holes or loops have been set in such a way that
the front, and thus the portrait of the Roman emperor, was displayed. Such imitations of Roman coins, which were presumably
produced by the developing elites right across the north of the Roman frontier and used by them to demonstrate their status provide an insight of this cultural meeting, a synthesis of Roman and indigenous societies. In my contribution I would like to present
some material that looks like money in coin form – and was quite sure manufactured like genuine roman coins – but underwent a
transformation in meaning.
