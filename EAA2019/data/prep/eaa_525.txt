gradual fall of the Western Roman Empire and the ‘dust-veil event’ of 536/37. Thus, in the Merovingian Period gold is very rear.
When found it is often in the shape of small gold foil figures, usually at settlements with a centre-function.
Events overarching both crafters and consumers resulting to limited access to a specific material, and the responses to such
events, here seen in the clear shift of contexts where gold is present, makes a backdrop for this paper. The ways in which gold
was used as part of the social and economic strategies of the elite drastically changed throughout this time, and so did the
knowledge of crafters working with gold as part of the elites strategies. Within this backdrop I wish to explore and reflect upon
the dynamics and interaction between elites, crafters, and the access to gold within this very distinct historical context.
