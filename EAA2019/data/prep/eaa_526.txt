Presentation Format: Oral
During the reconstruction of Haapsalu Episcopal Castle, a 17th century cesspit containing a selection of glass finds was discovered. This discovery proved a vital link in connecting the first known Estonian glass factory, Hüti (1628-1664) to its owners, the
De la Gardie family through archaeology. The family owned large estates and built churches and manor houses which still bear
testament to their social status and role in local and state affairs but their connection to the factory was previously only possible
to study on paper. Through written records, we know that the De la Gardies rarely visited the factory but they were instrumental
in making glass a wide-spread commodity in Estonia which had previously relied on imported glass. This paper looks at how the
needs and demands of the De la Gardie family, the owners but also the largest consumers of the factory, influenced the artistic
freedom of the glass masters at Hüti.
