CONCEALING CRAFTING AS A MESSAGE TO THE USER

Scholars frequently point to the high quality of craftsmanship in a particular object or class of objects as evidence for specialization. Presumably the skill set of the artisan who made the blade of an inlaid Minoan dagger was different from that of the hand
responsible for the intricate niello inlay. Luxury objects acquired value from both the investment of the material but also the
amount of labor - in this instance the work of two crafters - who produced the object. The art of Minoan Crete in both the Protopalatial and the Neopalatial phases (roughly 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE) is replete with labor-intensive pottery, seals, frescoes and
other objects. Display and use reinforced the elite status of the fortunate few.
This brief paper looks at a category of objects in which, it is argued, a quite different message was intended. Every bit as much
a part of Minoan palatial life as the luxury goods, the conical cup by contrast was a homely item - undecorated, often irregular in
profile. Manufactured by the thousands, they played a crucial role in palatial ritual feasts. As a product of a ceramic production
that could produce eggshell ware and the complex patterns of Kamares pottery the artlessness of the conical cups seems from
a different world. Did the makers of the cups intentionally conceal the crafting involved in their manufacture? Was this apparent
“craftlessness” intended to convey to their users a message about their status in the larger social fabric? This paper raises
the larger question about the techniques crafters used to convey social messages and concludes our session by reflecting on
crafting as messaging.
