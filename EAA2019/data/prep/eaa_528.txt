Format: Regular session
The long-critiqued dichotomy between Mesolithic and Neolithic lifeways hides a vast range of adaptations, transitional and
mixed economies, and alternative regional trajectories. However, these remain poorly characterised, both terminologically and
from an economic and social point of view.
In this session, we focus on this muddy middle part of the scale, particularly in contexts in which an adaptation of various and
potentially quite diverse ‘Neolithic economic packages’ to new kinds of environments was needed (e.g. to a coastal or mountainous habitat). Such challenges required considerable economic and social adaptation and creativity. In particular, we want to ask:
•
Was Neolithisation rapid or slow, and in which circumstances were different paces achieved?
•
How durable and intensive were these new economic patterns?
•
How can we trace them archaeologically? For instance, what would these look like in the on-site and off-site records, or
in terms of plant macroremains?
•
What are the preservation potentials in different regions? Are ‘incomplete Neolithic packages’ due to such taphonomic
factors, or to a genuine diversity in adaptations?
•
Was there a predictable sequence of adaptive steps, following logically from each other, or is there diversity? Are our
chronologies at a high enough resolution to distinguish between alternative scenarios, especially were the spread is
rapid (e.g. coastal colonisation)?
