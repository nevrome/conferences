You are either a hunter-gatherer or a farmer. Once the initial excitement of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition is over, and the
first evidence of a fully agricultural economy has been identified, then a predictable path is set. Or is it? Over the last decades,
archaeologists have increasingly come up against societies who do not seem to fit easily to such labels, and who practise a vast
range of mixed economies. This sort of evidence is often found at the margins of ‘core’ Neolithisation areas and in the interstices between Neolithisation routes. There are also many situations in which elements of agriculture or animal husbandry are
being adapted to a suite of new environments, such as island settings, higher altitudes or new soil types. Mostly in such cases,
especially where evidence of hunting, gathering and fishing is involved, our efforts remain centred on the question whether this
adaptability is a sign of ‘Mesolithic’ involvement or not, leading to a quagmire of terminological confusion.
In this introductory paper, we would like to present some models for what may be happening when elements of agriculture and
animal husbandry are adapted to new kinds of environment. This question is, on the one hand, methodological (accurate dating,
identification of relevant behaviours, taphonomy, visibility in on- and off-site data and site categories…). But it is also a question
of economy, and not least of social change. By offering a first comparative perspective, we hope to lay the foundations for discussion in the rest of the session.
