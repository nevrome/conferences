The Neolithization of Balkans was explained in different way, but many do agree that it was a process initiated by Anatolian
communities that introduced new modes of living among indigenous foraging societies. But besides the numerous quantities of
evolving data there are still debates on how this process was integrated from the coasts to the continental parts of the peninsula. Was it a rapid colonization or slow adaptive migration and were the social transformations made due to Anatolian linkages or
new identities were established as result of interaction between newcomers and natives. For some of the Balkan countries there
is a solid data that is used in an attempt to explain the chronological and economic frames of this agricultural process although
many questions still emerge. But for others there is still scarcity of information that can firmly determine when and how the first
farmers inhabited the region and were they integrating or putting aside the local foragers.
The research on Neolithic sites in the Republic of Macedonia has been more intensive in the last decade in spite of a big gap
since 1970â€™s when the most of the knowledge on Neolithization process was obtained. The recent studies provide new results
on chronology, spatial patterns, agriculture, herding, economy, buildings, identity and rituals, but the gap of few decades has
impact in the insubstantiality of the hypotheses for determining the initial stages of Neolithization and its advance in later phases. Nevertheless, some reliable data on temporal frames, demographic spread, social formations, economic preferences and
iconographic norms could be provided and arguments for Neolithic process could be proposed as well.
