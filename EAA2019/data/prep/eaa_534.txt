One of the main routes of the spread of farming into Europe follows the eastern Adriatic coast as far north as the Caput Adriae,
where the Karst is located: specific physiographic conditions, history of field research and of studies make the Neolithisation of
this area similar but different from that of the surrounding ones.
In the Karst, since the first discovery of the Mesolithic in the Azzurra cave in the early 1960s, its presence has been detected in
18 cavities and 1 probable open-air site. The following Neolithic – named Vlaška Group, Danilo-Vlaška, Gruppo dei vasi a coppa – is
recorded in 14 of these caves, but almost everywhere (with one possible significant exception at Edera cave) after a sedimentological/chronological gap.
14C dates are few but would indicate that the Neolithic started at around 5600-5500 BC and lasted for at least 1 millennium.
Danilo-Vlaška materials – pottery, flaked blades and polished stone axes, faunal remains of domesticated animals (mostly ovi-
