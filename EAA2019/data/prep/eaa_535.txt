caprines) – are present in more than 40 caves in total, but in highly variable numbers, from one to many hundreds, presumably
due to the nature of modern discovery (occasional findings vs. systematic excavations) on the one hand, and of ancient use on
the other. Geo-archaeological studies have in fact demonstrated that many caves were used by shepherds with their flocks of
sheep and goats for millennia, with variable intensity and continuity. Archaeometric analyses of polished stone artefacts have
contributed to identifying the extent of their movements and to hypothesizing the exchange mechanisms involved, in which the
availability of sea salt along the coast could have played an important role.
Under current paradigms, these data would suggest an “incomplete Neolithic package”, but an alternative interpretation would
value the smart site-specific adaptation of human groups to Karst areas.
