The archaeobotanical finds provide information not only on the plants consumed by the inhabitants of given site, but also on the
natural habitats which were used by those people. The available evidence shows that the economy and nutrition strategies of
the Neolithic farming population in the Lower Danube have certain elements in common with those of the Mesolithic hunter-fisher-gatherers, such as their affinity to aquatic resources. This may have been an adaptation to local environmental conditions,
but can also indicate the survival of a Mesolithic cultural tradition in Neolithic practice. The evidence from plant macrofossil analyses and wood charcoal analyses from those areas point that the both the Mesolithic and Neolithic populations targeted open
woodlands rich in fruits (like cornelian cherry, wild apple/pear, elder etc.) and also riparian forests and other aquatic resources
(most prominent example the water chestnut). In the current contribution we present evaluation of the possible habitats used
by Mesolithic and Neolithic populations in the areas of Banat, Iron Gates and Lower Danube plain in combination with the paleobotanical evidence. By incorporating this data in the overall picture for the natural and cultural developments in the period before
and after the spread of farming in the Lower Danube catchment, we would like to critically evaluate the hypothesis for continuity
of discontinuity of the Mesolithic subsistence and land use practices in this region.
