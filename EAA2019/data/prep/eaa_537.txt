In popular opinion, southern Poland was a classical area of early Neolithic settlement which was rarely exploited, and even ignored, by Mesolithic communities. However, southern Poland is in fact an area of diverse landscapes. Loess uplands which
constitute a considerable part of the region indeed remained basically unoccupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, and these
uplands became only settled by the first Neolithic farmers (Linear Band Pottery culture) in the third quarter of the sixth millennium BC. In other landscapes, however, primarily those similar to Lowland ones, numerous remains of Mesolithic occupation have
been recorded, including late Mesolithic ones. Thanks to radiocarbon datings it is currently obvious that late Mesolithic societies
continued to develop there at least until the mid-fifth millennium BC, simultaneously with ‘Linear’ and ‘post-Linear’ farmers. Anthropological and historical interpretations of possible relations between these two cultural formations are difficult. It is even
more challenging to assess the role played by Mesolithic populations in the Neolithisation of southern Poland. In this presentation we will analyse the chronological, environmental, settlement, and typological data from the perspective of these problems.
As a result, the probability of three basic hypotheses will be evaluated. These hypotheses assume that Mesolithic communities:
(1) were passive witnesses of the Neolithisation; (2) provided an essential population substrate for this process; (3) underwent
disintegration during its course.
