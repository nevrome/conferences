The Mediterranean neolithisation process is known to be a complex and polymorph phenomenon with a large variety of exploited
environments, diversified economic resources and regionalisation process identified by the high variability in time and space
of ceramic styles… The aim of this paper is to discuss the emergence dynamics of the Neolithic process in the southwestern
part of France based on new data obtained in the PROCOME project funded by the French National Agency of Research. The
PROCOME Project dealt with the conditions surrounding the emergence and the evolution of agro-pastoral societies during the
6th millennium cal. BCE, especially in the hinterlands. Based on a renewed corpus of data and an interdisciplinary approach, this
work allows us to consider two main issues in relation with the session “At the fringe of early Neolithisation – from the coasts to
the mountains”:
•
The traditionally accepted model that human communities first settled in coastal areas is challenged by new high-precision chronology which allows us to also identify an early continental pathway.
•
These new ecosystems were rapidly exploited, alongside a diversification of food acquisition systems, based on both
domestic and wild resources.
Our goal is to discuss this variety of situations and to pay particular attention to the question of environmental and social dynamics involved in the Neolithisation process.
