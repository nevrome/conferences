The best known studies of the Neolithic plant economy of the Alpine region are from the pile-dwelling sites of the massif stretching from Lake Geneva to Lake Constance, and to a lesser extent in Northern Italy. However, the first lake and wetland villages
did not appear until the Middle Neolithic, around 4400 cal. BC. The only existing data of the transition from the Mesolithic to the
Neolithic therefore comes from open-air sites, shelters, or caves located in the pre-Alpine mountains and the internal Alps.
In recent years, archaeobotanical analyses from the Alps of Switzerland and Northern France have been carried out on occupations dating from 5300 to 4500 BC. New data is now available to fill a gap, both chronological and spatial, in this region by providing details of the plant exploitation of late hunter-gatherers and the first agropastoral communities.
This paper presents several recent case studies that allow us to renew our knowledge of the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition as
well as the alpine neolithization process. What can archaeobotany tell us about the plant economy of the last hunter-gatherers
and the first farmers? When and where did cultivated plants first appear? How can we characterize the subsistence economy of
the first farmers? This presentation will also provide an opportunity to discuss the integration of other approaches and methods
(eg: archaeozoology, charcoal analysis, and isotopic analyses) as a means for addressing the occupation of the Alps by the first
farmers.
