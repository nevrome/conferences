Thirty years ago the seminal article by C. Erny-Rodmann, E. Gross-Klee and S. Jacomet on early human impact in Switzerland
[Früher ”human impact” und Ackerbau im Übergangsbereich Spätmesolithikum-Frühneolithikum im schweizerischen Mittelland,
1997] discussed off-site data of human impact as possible indications that Neolithic activities started much earlier than the
famous pile dwellings. The following debate concentrated on the possibility of identifying Neolithisation processes with off-site
data in the absence of archaeological on-site data.
Since then, huge survey projects, detailed excavations and many new off-site records with high-resolution analyses have added
not only new data, but also new possibilities of merging on- and off-site archaeology, palynology, archaeobotany and geoarchaeology to investigate the transition phases of the 6th and 5th millennia BCE. They provide novel insights into causes and processes of major environmental changes occurring in this period, such as the mass expansion of beech or the elm and lime declines.
We will present the new data in a chronological overview and discuss the explanatory power, representativeness and biases of
both on- and off-site methods and data in understanding the Neolithisation process in the Alpine Forelands.
