EARLY NEOLITHIC SOUTH NORWAY

There is an understanding – though sometimes unspoken - among scholars that all past inhabitants of Norway were dependent,
in some way or another, on marine resources. From Early Mesolithic foragers to recent fisher-farmers, the sea has held significance economically, socially, and probably also spiritually. Due to a strong culture-historical research tradition in Scandinavia,
this understanding has found an awkward position in Neolithic (3900-2350 cal BCE) knowledge production, which has had a tendency to suppress ideas of mixed (or muddy) economic orientations. This paper presents a bottom-up approach to the Early Neolithic in south Norway. Results from recent excavations at the wetland site Jortveit, Skagerrak coast (south Norway), enforces
a revision of previous ideas concerning marine adaptation among early farming communities in this region. The discovery of large
amounts of fish bones and osseous artefacts preserved inside a prehistoric seabed indicate a mixed economic orientation in
the mid-4th millennium BC. The site suggests that seasonal mass killing of tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was an important communal
tradition among early farming communities in the Skagerrak region. Other aspects of the Jortveit site indicate a cultural history
connected to Neolithic groups in Central and Eastern Europe orientated towards ‘wild’ resources.
