DEVELOPMENTS 4000-1800 BCE IN SOUTH NORWAY?

In most of Europe, the term ‘Neolithic’ refers to the agricultural transition, comprising cultures with pottery, specific axe types,
houses, crops and animal husbandry. In Norway, on the fringe of northern Europe, this is not necessarily the case. Some see the
region as displaying only an ‘artefactual’ Neolithic, because of the varying presence of elements of the ‘package’. Others argue
that there was no Neolithic in Norway prior to c.2300 BC, since the transition to farming did not take place until then. Therefore,
an impression of a ‘true’ Neolithic lingers, implying the existence of a process moving towards Neolithisation, with a society
where agriculture was the economic subsistence base as a goal.
However, although the chronological period between c. 4000 and 1800 BC in Norway bears the name ‘Neolithic’, the dominant
way of life was hunting, gathering, and fishing. If the name of the period set the premise for research on this period, should
we instead abandon the name, and operate with only a chronological skeleton comprising of calibrated years BC to enable discussions of existing local and regional material culture across different regions? Is this perhaps a better point of departure for
developing a new understanding of the various developing historical trajectories? Instead of operating as if something is lacking,
i.e. ‘Neolithic elements’, developments should be acknowledged as depending on geographical location, social institutions and
strategies, human preferences, and ontological understanding existing in parallel. Various Norwegian archaeological examples
will be used to explore this issue.
