The Lower Volga Region is located in the steppe and semi-desert zones. The features of the development of cultures were influenced by the specificity of the natural environment. Cattle breeding could not occur among the local population here: there
was no wild sheep in the Lower Volga Region. According to archaeological data, the emergence of cattle breeding in this area is
associated with the advent of a new culture. This is confirmed by new types of ceramics and the transition the stone industry.
The natural specificity of the steppe and semi-desert regions was unsuitable for the development of farming. Thus, the full Neolithic package could not be formed in the Lower Volga Region. Initially (5 300 BC), only sheep breeding is recorded in the Caspian
culture. But it was not the dominant form of the economy: the bones of wild animals predominate. The number of monuments of
the Caspian culture does not increase. There is no reason to assume a sharp demographic growth. It is not possible to consider
this model to be intense. About 5 000 BC, besides sheep, cattle appear in the materials of the Khvalynskaya culture of this region. The number of monuments is increasing. The number of artifacts is increasing. The remains of dwellings were found. This
indicates a greater sedentary lifestyle than in earlier cultures. On the other hand, in contrast to earlier times, seasonal mobility of
the population is recorded in semi-desert and steppe regions of the Lower Volga Region, over the period from 5200 to 4500 BC. It
was because of changing periods of aridization and moisture and was a form of adaptation of pastoralists. Thus, the Lower Volga
Region can be considered as a special eastern periphery of the neolithization centers with a mixed form of the model.
