The study of pottery of the ancient world is an important element to analyze the contacts and the transmissions of social and
cultural models. By this way, in consideration of its geographical extension and the long process of its political, economic and socio-cultural hegemony, the Roman Age can be a privileged field of study in a research perspective, that aims to highlighting how
and how much the dynamics of integration following the conquest are carried out, also through the commercialization of pottery
classes and uses of some vessel shapes. In fact, this latter topic can constitute an important way to demonstrate the possible
relations between the diffusion of specific vessel shapes and the transmission of Roman traditions and symbolic customs, in
the geographical area object of this investigation.
Given these premises, the so-called local productions also play a key role in this work of interpretation of the pottery material
culture, because they are inspired by the great Mediterranean circulation and represent a focal point for understanding, in a primarily comparative perspective, the different degree of penetration of the Roman integration processes, in different social and
geographical contexts. For example, the selection of ceramic forms can reflect the spread of cultural models, as in the case of
those that seem to be directly linked to food trends. Therefore, in the comparison of the various contexts proposed, this study
could make a significant contribution to a coherent reconstruction of these kinds of phenomena. In fact, this approach in the
study of material culture can be workable to the analysis of the models of ‘Romanity’. It will be important to highlight the role and
importance of local productions as phenomena that could be the expression of reception and re-elaboration of Roman cultural
models in a diachronic perspective.
