Presentation Format: Oral
Ceramics is an irreversible material and for this reason it is one of the few indicators able to tell us stories of everyday life that
escape the narratives of ancient authors. With pottery we can make economic, social, religious, but also anthropological history.
It is the main tool for cooking and eating food and its shapes are the result of a series of factors related to time, place of production, knowledge of the craftsman and the values shared by the group of origin. The forms are also closely linked to the functions
and food traditions of the people who have used them. Therefore, studying the ceramic material, and especially its diffusion and
composition, is also an instrument to follow the stages of the movements of individuals from one part of the Mediterranean to
another and from one part and another of ancient Italy. We will see through a series of cases chosen from the common and late
republican and late antique ceramics of various regions of Italy in which way we can trace the presence of ethnic groups in places
far from their origins and the reasons underlying these presences.
