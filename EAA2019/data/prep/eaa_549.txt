In the last thirty years the archaeological excavations carried out in major centres and minor sites of the Cisalpine area collected
lots of data on Roman pottery in Northern Italy. The findings significantly contribute to the definition of the socio-economic
changes which involved this area during the Roman period and provide a valuable information on the production and exchange
networks developed over the centuries. Nevertheless, the general framework is still fragmentary, in particular for local productions.
In the Roman site of Calvatone-Bedriacum (Cr), where the University of Milan has been working for more than thirty years, a significant local production has been isolated, which is a coarse ware bowl with peculiar typological and technological characteristics,
identified as an indicator of the production areas of the site during the mid-Roman period. Because of its important and unusual
role of chronological and functional marker within the Roman vicus and because of its relevance, due to its heavy presence and
its close link with some distinctive areas and activities, this peculiar coarse ware vessel was defined ”Calvatone bowl”.
The paper will focus on the analysis of the ”Calvatone bowl” as a cultural marker of the mid-Roman period (2nd-3rd centuries AD),
with the aim of including it within the framework of the local productions of the central Cisalpine area by comparing it with coarse
ware from reference sites recently investigated (Como, Milan, Brescia, Cremona).
