Presentation Format: Oral
The study of the materials coming from the territory of Mondolfo (Marche region, Italy) provided further data for the knowledge
of local and imported ceramics into the ager Gallicus. The data can be compared with those of Suasa, a Roman city in the Cesano
valley, and other contexts of the Middle-Adriatic area. In fact, all the classes in the area are represented, such as the local gray
pottery produced in the first years of Romanization (first half of the 3rd century B.C.), Black Gloss Ware, both local and imported,
Gray Impasto Ware, Thin Walled Pottery, also of local production, Italian and Middle Adriatic Sigillata and African Red Slip Ware.
However, there are also novelties with regard to the trade of amphorae and coarse wares from the Levantine area but also from
the coasts of the eastern Adriatic. This work tries to demonstrate that, during the roman age, the Marche region were linked to
the maritime traffics as much as the other Italian Adriatic coasts.
