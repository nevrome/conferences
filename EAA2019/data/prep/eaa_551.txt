The Roman Municipium of Urvinum Hortense is situated in Umbria, south of Perugia and represents one of the most important
archaeological site in Central Italy during the middle Empire Age.
Amazingly, in subsequent centuries the site of Urvinum Hortense has never been developed or substantially occupied. As such,
the site provides a unique opportunity to study the preserved monuments, the stratigraphy and the artefacts.
With regard to the material culture a considerable number of ceramic artefacts, both imported material and local production have
been found during twelve Archaeological investigation. Among these objects, a type of fine ware realized with yellow purified
clay extracted from the bedrock of the hill is particularly significant.
The aim of this paper is to examine this class of objects. The results could provide useful information on:
•
Typological listing of artefacts realized with the local clay.
•
The numerical and percentage distribution of these objects in the investigated sectors of the Roman Municipium.
•
The chronology of the production.
•
The exploitation of clay from the hill.
