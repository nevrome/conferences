THE ROMAN CULTURE

During 2014-2015 archaeological excavations in Cagliari (south Sardinia, Italy), a singular alignment of eight ceramic pots with
perforated bottom was found along the walls of a rectangular room of a building used from the Late Republican Age until at least
the Late Antiquity. These ceramic pots, dated to the first half of the 1st century CE, have been interpreted as ollae perforatae.
According to the agricultural manuals written by Theophrastus, Cato the Elder and Palladius, these artifacts, which came especially from Campania, were perforated planting-pots employed in the Roman arboriculture and horticulture in order to make
gardens, in both domestic and religious architecture. These pots often had one or more intentional holes on side or base so that
the roots of trees and flowering shrubs could be planted in the soil.
Some of the earthenware pots discovered in Cagliari are characterized by the same morphological and typological features of
the ollae perforatae coming from Pompeii and, like these artifacts, even the Sardinian ones contained soil fertilized by rests of
shells and sea urchins spines. The presence of these perforated planting-pots in Cagliari could prove the existence of a garden
in a residential area where rich thermal baths were built and decorated with sculptures of deities.
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how these ollae perforatae represent an efficacious marker of the so-called Roman
acculturation processes, expressed also through the building of thermal baths and gardens, two typical means of diffusion of
the Roman culture.
