Presentation Format: Oral
Studies on black-gloss ware developed in Sardinia in recent years show, more and more precisely, that local productions are
often the most attested classes. Starting substantially from the third century BC, continuing towards the late Republican age to
reach the imperial age, occurs in different areas of Sardinia the presence of artifacts that intend to replicate or sometimes just
resemble the black-gloss, suggesting the possibility of interpreting this phenomenon as an obvious and repeated attempt to
establish a relationship of cultural proximity with a ‘dominant’ fashion. As regards the black-gloss ware in this specific case, this
attempt is declined as an instrument of cultural mediation and social and economic interaction. Starting from these premises,
this work intends to present some case studies that mainly refer to southern Sardinia trying to clarify some aspects around the
times and problems related to local ceramic production and consequently to the selection mechanisms for the local premises,
which determine the use and value of the containers.
