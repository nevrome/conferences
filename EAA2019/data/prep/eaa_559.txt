Nora is a town with a long story and a complex cultural tradition that, in its first centuries, appears to be strictly linked to the
customs and practices of the Punic world.
This tradition, favoured also by the geographic position on the Mediterrean Sea, can be easily found in the culinary practices, as
testified by kitchenware and food preparation pottery shapes used between the 4th century BC and 2nd century BC.
As it happened in the construction of imposing buildings of the town, also in the practices of everyday life, innovations coming
from the Roman culture is progressive and particularly slow and the spreading of the new tendencies lives together with the
persistence of the Punic underlayers.
Markers of these changes are visible in the private and pubblic life, where the adoption of codified forms used for the self-representation is evident (for instance in buildings and in the tableware pottery). Other markers, certainly less obvious but as much
as important and even more substantial, demonstrate the deep rootedness of some Roman habits, that merge with the local
traditions, regardless the exterior appearences of the self-representation.
Amongst these last markers, there is the use of some pottery shapes, that clearly shows a change in the taste of preparing and
cooking food. The spreading of these changes in the local culture in Nora is also showed by the diffusion of various imitation
products.
