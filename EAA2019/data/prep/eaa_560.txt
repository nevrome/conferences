The local production and importation of coarse and cooking wares in the Mediterranean, between the middle imperial age and
late antiquity, has always been a stimulating field of archeological study. Being a complex period marked by changes and transformations, scholars have attempted to understand the cultural dynamics of this geographical basin. Sardinia is located in the
middle of these trade among the North Africa, Hispania, Italy, Pantelleria and Eastern Mediterranean area and it has been marked
by continuous and constant interactions between local and allogeneic elements. The island represents an exemplary case study
to decode these aspects as attested by the findings, especially pottery, in some archaeological contexts of the southern area
of the region. This study aims to outline the main elements that help to define the relationship between local production and
imports, in light of cultural and political events that characterised Sardinia between the third and eighth centuries AD.
