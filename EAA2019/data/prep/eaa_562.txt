ferent regions of the Roman Empire. What remains of those products are well known by archaeologists, and they make a great
chronological marker for this period.
These ceramics are characterized by a high degree of standardization. This can be explained by technical reasons (to easily
place the ceramics in the kiln or in the holds of ships), but it can also show cultural implications, representing one of the unifying
features of the Roman Empire. In this regard, the success of African pottery is demonstrated by the presence of imitations in
different parts of the Mediterranean and beyond, like England or the Pontic region.
Sicily represents a privileged field to study African pottery: the proximity to Africa can explain the wide presence of these ceramics, that followed different distribution circuits as sub-regional differences show.
This paper will examine the presence of African Red Slips ware in two areas of Sicily, where the University of Palermo carry out
surveys: the region of Termini Imerese (northern coast) and the region of Agrigento (southern coast). The analysis of vases
shapes, linked to the study of fabrics, allows us to detect different areas of production and in some cases the atelier.
However, next to the best known and successful types we find some ceramics, especially flanged bowls that closely resemble
African products, whose fabrics seem to differ from the main African productions. Are we dealing with products of secondary
or unknown ateliers or they are local imitations? If the second hypothesis is correct, what is the reason to copy a very common
product in Sicily?
