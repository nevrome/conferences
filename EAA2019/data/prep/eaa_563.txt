Ancient Cyrenaica (modern Libya) was the land located at the crossroads of the main maritime trade routes. It was also a place
where Greek and Roman influences mixed. One of the most important cities of the Libyan Pentapolis was Ptolemais, which during
the reign of Diocletian became the capital of the newly created province Libya Superior.
During the excavation conducted by a mission of the Institute of Archaeology of the University of Warsaw (2001-2010), a dozen fragments of late antique moulds for firing terracotta lamps were discovered. Research on the moulds and the lamps that
matched them indicate their local production. The interpretation of the artefacts juxtaposed with the lamps found at other sites
in Cyrenaica let us formulate the types and decorative schemes popular in local manufacturing. They constitute an important
element in the discussion on both inter- and supra-regional relations that shaped the patterns used in local workshops. Moreover, further conclusions based on the analysis of ceramics, made it possible to define the trade model between Cyrenaica and
other regions.
