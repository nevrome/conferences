strates the relations between Romans and locals. In the West of Hispania, the use of lychnological artefacts were already used,
but within the Roman framework they were subject to significative innovations, especially in terms of morphology and frequency.
The contact with the products brought by Romans promoted the circulation of new types of vessels, but also inspired the local
productions. If, on one hand, we can suggest that italic products promoted the “Romanity” of Hispanic populations, on the other,
we must consider these artefacts as a symbiosis between two different cultures.
In this paper, we will present an overview of the Hispanic productions of Roman lamps, from the II century BC to the I century
AD, exposing some chronological and typological questions that are relevant to the understanding of the Roman social-cultural
adaptation. The more antique lamp (re)produtions are linked to military movements and the conquest of Hispania, but some artefacts show different influences, materialised in lamps with Roman morphologies and local details. The existence of more and
more potters in this geographical area culminated in a massive production of Roman lamps, some of them conceived by Hispanic
artisans.
Some strategic settlements will be presented in order to establish a coherent and diachronic perspective of the consumption
and production of Roman lamps. This analysis is relevant to the understanding of the evolution of the production of lychonological artefacts in the Western Mediterranean and its morphological features.
