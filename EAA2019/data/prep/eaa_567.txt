BEGINNING OF THE ROMANIZATION OF THE IBERIAN POPULATION

Some archaeological sites located on promontories of the north coast of Alicante were interpreted as small Iberian enclaves
from the 2nd and 1st century BC dedicated to trade with Rome. This interpretation stemmed from their location next to good
inlets and the outstanding number of Roman amphorae and, fine ware among the findings. The research being developed since
2010 reinterprets these sites as a network of forts built during the Sertorian wars, around 77 BC, to control the passage of
senatorial ships between Ebusus and Carthago Nova. In this new context, Roman ceramics are no longer the object of exchange
between Iberians and Italic merchants, but the kitchen and tableware used by legionaries, as well as the storage containers for
their own food. The Iberian amphorae and other painted Iberian vessels present in the forts are the containers of the products
that the Iberian population, allied with Sertorius, provided for the provisioning of the soldiers, but it may also be pointing out a
hypothetical presence of Iberian auxilia in the coastal garrisons. In any case, it is through this contact, in the midst of a war in the
70’s BC, when the Iberian population of the regio Contestania first encounters the Roman economic system and starts the slow
but inexorable transmission of new cultural values.
