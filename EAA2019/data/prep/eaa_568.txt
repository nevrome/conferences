Presentation Format: Oral
The Roman conquest of Carthago Nova (Cartagena) in 209 B.C. and the following creation of the Hispania Citerior province represented the beginning of a progressive process of economic and cultural ‘romanization’ in the south of Spain. In the 1st cent. B.C,
this complex phenomenon was improved by the presence in this area of new Roman armies, during the hard civil wars among Sertorius, Pompeius Magnus and Caesar. One of the most important consequences of these historical events was the implantation
of the famous Lucius Eros figlina. In this potter’s workshop, Iberian artisans made both Roman lamps and typical painted Iberian
pottery which imitated the shapes of the thin walled Italic pottery. This production represented an important example of the
connections between the Iberian culture and the Roman one and it was commercialized in the most important cities of southern
Spain, such as Carthago Nova (Cartagena), Ilici (Elche) or Lucentum (Alicante).
