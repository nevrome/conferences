The archaeological data of Policastro Bussentino (Santa Marina, SA), also collected thanks to recent research conducted by the
University of Genoa, provide evidence that the settlement had already taken a central role in the control of the most important
trade networks along the coastal routes from the gulf of Naples to the Messina strait since the Archaic period. Furthermore, its
port and the course of the nearby Bussento river guaranteed the activities of a hub for the exchanges that ended at the Diano
valley, thus favouring a network of close relations with the sub-regional areas and the surrounding colonial settlements.
This framework is defined in a more precise way by the most ancient indigenous production in the sub-geometric Oenotrian
style, dated to the period between the end of the sixth and the first half of the fifth century BC, and for which there are manifest
similarities with the material evidence found at Parco Pinto, with styles reminiscent of what was documented at the nearby
Palinuro, Sala Consilina and Tortora. They contribute to define and confirm the role that Policastro and his hinterland have had in
this complex cultural framework.
