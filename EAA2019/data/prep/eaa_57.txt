ARZAWA, ASSUWA, AND MIRA: THREE NAMES FOR ONE AND THE SAME COUNTRY IN WESTERN ANATOLIA
Author(s): Wouduizen, Fred (Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society)
Presentation Format: Oral
In the present paper the evidence concerning the geographic names Arzawa, Assuwa, and Mira from Hittite, Luwian hieroglyphic,
Egyptian and Mycenaean sources will be reviewed in order to determine whether these are three distinct countries or multiple
references to one and the same realm in western Anatolia. Starting point will be that in the Hittite, Luwian hieroglyphic, and
Egyptian hieroglyphic sources there can be found evidence that Arzawa, Assuwa, and Mira, each at its own period, reached the
preeminent status of a great kingdom. In principle, there is room in western Anatolia only for one great kingdom, by and large
corresponding to Lydia of the Archaic period.
In addition it will be investigated how the Homeric data on western Anatolia fit in with the Late Bronze Age evidence on the topic.
In doing so, it appears that Homer is ignorant of the country names Arzawa, Mira, Seha and Masa, but uses Maionia and Mysia
instead.
