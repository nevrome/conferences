Imported pottery (of Corinthian, Chiote, Ionic production) arrived to Policastro by sea and it was redistributed towards the towns
of the hinterland (Roccagloriosa among them), while the latter and the colonies, instead, were producing imitation pottery such
as the black varnish of Velia. The structure of this commercial network remained substantially unchanged even during the subsequent phase of Lucan occupation of the settlement/town, and persisted until the foundation of the Roman colony of Buxentum in
194 BC, when the new influences radically changed the social, cultural and economic structure of the Gulf of Policastro.
