The practice of surgical body manipulations has deep roots in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic ages. The earliest cases seem to
be the Upper Palaeolithic symbolic trepanation from Telmanovskaya site and the surgical one of the Mesolithic male Vasilyevka
3. Surgical operations could be used for rites of passage , as could be argued for the case of a young woman from the Mesolithic
Mursak-Koba site. When she was teenager, both her little fingers were amputated , then when she married she was subjected to a symbolic trepanation. The osteological collection from the Museum of Man in Paris still has no analogies regarding the
representation of ancient trepanations in the Old World. My study concerns a re-examination of skulls with traces of intravital
trepanations. I have looked at two categories of objects from the collection of Neolithic trepanned skulls: trepanned skulls and
bone plates (rondelles). The evidence is indicative of the complexity of the spiritual life in the Stone Age and allows to trace the
development of surgical intervention techniques among people in different chronological periods: from late Neolithic farmers to
Gauls (Celts), and early medieval Merovingians.
