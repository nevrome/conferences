Anatomical models as votive offerings are a worldwide phenomenon. In Greek civilisation they occur multiple times. They are
famously found as clay offerings in the Classical Greek and Roman temples of Asklepios, and of course, as gold and silver tamata beside icons in modern Greek chapels. Their earliest manifestation however, is within Minoan Bronze Age civilisation on
the mountain shrines known as peak sanctuaries. Here they form part of the characteristic votive assemblage of clay figurines
which defines the ritual practices of the peak sanctuaries. We (with Christine Morris and Brendan Oâ€™Neil) are publishing this material as part of the collaborative East Cretan Peak Sanctuaries project, which seeks to publish old material originally excavated
by Prof. Costis Davaras. We have identified far more votive limbs than originally expected. This demonstrates that these are
not merely random representations, but reveal a consistent of the recognition of disease within Minoan culture. Furthermore,
while most of these show the part of the body affected, some show recognisable symptoms of disease. Through this paper
we propose to place these finds within the broader phenomenology of anatomical votives, especially considering that they are
amongst the earliest examples.
