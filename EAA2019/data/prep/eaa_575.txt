PURIFICATION RITUALS AND THE NOTION OF HYGIENE IN MYCENAEAN GREECE

Presentation Format: Oral
The concept of pollution and ritual purity in Mycenaean Greece can be supported by archaeological and written evidence. The
presence of specific installations for the performance of ablutions in cult buildings, the evidence for fumigation rites and the
burning of incense in chamber tombs and shrines attest to notions of ritual cleansing before the performance of religious rites
and the idea of pollution, particularly in relation to the dead body. Traces of fire inside chamber tombs have been interpreted as
fumigation rites performed in order to purify the atmosphere prior to re-entering the tomb. Such a practice could reflect the notion of impurity associated with the dead body, but at the same time might have served also a more practical function, that is, to
protect those coming into contact with the dead from health risks. The aim of this paper is to examine whether some purification
rites performed by the Mycenaeans could have some reference to aspects of hygiene, in addition to the religious belief in pollution and ritual cleansing, attesting to a basic understanding of contagion and health risk.
