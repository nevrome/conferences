Thrace for its most part is situated on the territory of present-day Bulgaria, a country famous for its many sources of mineral
water highly valued for its medicinal properties. Romans made use of the waters by establishing healing settlements near most
springs. Only some of those spas have been a subject of large scale excavations mainly focusing on the Roman remains and
paying less head to the Late Iron age material. Despite this, the publications summarizing the results of the research often
state a continuous use of the springs for medicinal purposes since at least the Late Iron age. But what is the basis for such an
interpretation?
Often it is the discovery of small finds that can be attributed to the Late Iron age, in other cases it is the unearthing of votive
tablets and cult objects pointing to the use of the site for religious purposes. However, can this be interpreted as evidence for
the use of the mineral water for healing purposes as argued by some archaeologists? And how does such an interpretation fit into
what little we know about Thracian medicine? The paper addresses those matters by taking a closer look at the archaeological
remains, attributed to the Thracians and discovered in different Roman spas, believed to have been in use in the Late Iron age.
