In her publications of the small finds from Roman bathhouses, both public and military, A.M. Whitmore (2013 and 2016) called
our attention to the occurrence of textile tools among them, such as whorls, weights, needles and weaving tablets. She also
outlined several possibilities for the interpretation of their presence. First, they were not used as cloth working tools at all, but
among others as medical or hairdressing instruments or door-weights. According to her other interpretation they were used for
producing textiles or rather mending garments as a pass-time activity either by the bathers themselves or by slaves and attendants. Moreover, she suggested the possibility that this kind of activity could have been part of a commercial service in the baths.
The present paper will offer a different interpretation of these textile tools, based on the recent research on the finds found
in connection to the workshops which were probably providing textile and cloth refurbishing services (e.g. mending, cleaning,
redying) to the inhabitants of the Roman colonies of Savaria and Siscia, and will also emphasize the interdependence and vital
importance of corporeal and sartorial hygiene in densely populated regions, such as urban areas or military camps and the tragic
consequences of the absence of hygienic practices in the past.
