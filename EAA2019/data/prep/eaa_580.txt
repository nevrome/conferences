Plants are and have always been one of the main resources of human activity and, as such, their identification and study is
increasingly frequent in archaeological research, as well as relevant to palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. However, despite
numerous species and components being identified currently in the archaeological record and recognized for their pharmacological properties, few published studies discuss the possible knowledge and use of these medicinal plants by prehistoric communities.
To identify these evidences the construction of reference collections and the search for references will be of vital importance
for most of the archaeological disciplines, especially for those that are still in their defining phases, such as the case of the
paleopharmacological subdiscipline and the analysis of phytoliths.
The study of phytoliths in archaeological samples has always been based on the definition of morphotypes identified thanks
to the comparison with references of modern plants, there being many studies focused on the characterization of grasses or
other plants of recognized dietary or technological use. The present work aims to contribute to the study of the archeology of
medicine in prehistoric times, initiating the creation of a paleopharmacological reference collection of phytoliths from plants
with recognized pharmacological use documented in the archaeological record of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic in Catalonia
(Spain). The objective of these studies is to assess the viability of phytolith analysis as a proxy to identify medication behaviors
among prehistoric communities through the sampling of sediments, artifacts or dental calculus.
With our preliminary results, this poster aims to highlight the importance of creating new multiproxy references for the interpretation of the paleopharmacological record, especially for those periods in which we cannot rely on documentary sources or find
structures, objects or other indicators that can evince the existence of medicinal practices.
