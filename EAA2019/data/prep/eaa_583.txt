Viking Studies and Viking Age archaeology have long had a clear mission, to clarify and repair the image of the Vikings which
predominated for many years; barbarous savages, cast in the role of anti-Christ, storming through the sophisticated European
continent. These efforts have resulted in a remaking of their public image, and the complexity, sophistication, and interconnectedness of the Viking World is now extraordinarily well known. This singular focus on the Vikings, however, has led to the popular
perception of them as the predominant force from the North during the Early Medieval Period, overwhelming the developments
which were also taking place across the rest of the Baltic. The same perceptual misfortune that once befell the Viking has almost
now also befallen the Eastern and Southern Baltic. This presentation, based on the investigation undertaken as part of a completed PhD project, will present the phenomena of the urbanisation of the Baltic Region during the Viking Age. It will show that,
in fact, some archaeological traditions long thought of as emanating from the Viking homelands should in fact be viewed as an
‘extra-Viking’ phenomenon. Should the ‘Viking Age’ thus be discarded?
