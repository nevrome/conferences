In recent years, advances in scientific analyses have allowed scholars to re-examine a corpus of human remains, recovered from
a number of double- and triple-burials from across Scandinavia, in which the ‘primary’ occupant of the grave is accompanied by
one or more individuals who had suffered a violent death. These individuals are often interpreted as slaves who were sacrificed
in order to accompany their owners to the afterlife, a hypothesis that finds agreement in mythological and historical sources
that describe the killing of slaves as part of funerary rites. The most influential of these is undoubtedly the account of Ahmad ibn
Faḍlān, who in 922 witnessed the brutal killing of a slave-girl during the funeral of a Rūs chieftain on the banks of the Volga River.
While these sources are explicit in describing the sacrificial killings of slaves as part of the funerary process, the archaeological
evidence is less conclusive. Interpretations are often made based primarily on the atypical treatment of the dead themselves, a
problematic assertion that is usually supported by references to the written sources. The identification of remains that appear
to broadly conform with surviving narratives in turn serves to legitimise the sources themselves, meaning that scholars run the
risk of creating an interpretative ‘feedback loop,’ which limits the potential to study and understand these burials within their
individual archaeological contexts.
This paper outlines a study designed to explore the purported links between ritual violence and enslavement during the Viking
Age, which will combine the examination of ‘slave burials’ with a comparative analysis of social inequality, slavery, and ritual killings. The study will be implemented with a view to shedding light on the lives of the individuals who were the focus of these acts,
as well as the purposes that their deaths were intended to serve.
