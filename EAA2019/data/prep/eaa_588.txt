SUTTON HOO FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE

Most archaeologists, even in America, have some familiarity with the famous 7th century Anglo-Saxon burial site, Sutton Hoo.
Itâ€™s royal character, unique burial tradition, and characteristic material remains have come to body symbolize Anglo-Saxon culture, and even contributes to the national identity of the English. It came as a surprise, then, after beginning research on Vendel
Period burials on Gotland that the Sutton Hoo burial pattern should be found repeated there in Sweden, not once, but perhaps up
to 2 dozen times. The vast majority of English-language literature available on the subject suggests the the relationship between
Sutton Hoo and the Vendel sites are either coincidental or of minor significance. If not for the tacit agreement by the distinguished Swedish archaeologist, Sune Lindqvist, national bias among English scholars might be considered a likely explanation
for the accepted interpretations. However, as a neutral observer I find the argument that Sutton Hoo does not considerably
indicate a strong if not colonial presence of Swedish Vendel society to stretch credibility. As the dead do not bury themselves,
there must have been a community of people well-aware of the proper way to memorialize a Vendel leader. The existence of at
least 2 other similar burials in Suffolk must be considered to confirm a substantial Swedish influence on southeastern Britain.
An evaluation of the history of interpretations at Sutton Hoo helpfully reveals sources of bias and conflicts of interest among
previous stakeholders.
