viewpoint, with the peaceful Scandinavian farmer being pushed to the forefront of interpretation. This pacification of the past
can be seen in other time periods as well, with it having been a general theme in archaeology with many scholars discussing this
for a variety of time periods. This paper seeks to reconcile these two extreme viewpoints. In order to try for a more balanced
interpretation this paper explores the archaeological evidence from Orkney, a place known to have been inhabited by the Picts
and the Vikings simultaneously. By exploring the settlement and burial evidence from several sites a more balanced approach to
the archaeology is sought, trying neither to brutalize nor pacify the past.
