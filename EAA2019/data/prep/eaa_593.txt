TANGIBLE ENCOUNTERS – ‘FOREIGN’ OBJECTS IN VIKING AGE SCANDINAVIA

Presentation Format: Poster
A vital aspect of today’s understanding of the Viking Age are the intensive contacts between people from Scandinavia and their
neighbours around the North and Baltic Sea, the European continent as well as regions as far as the Byzantine Court or the Islamic Caliphate. The archaeological record shows clear traces of these contacts: objects of different and distant provenances have
found their way to Scandinavia – ranging from harness mounts from the British Isles, glass vessels produced in the Rhineland to
coins minted in Baghdad.
The aim of the project is to evaluate how these objects were incorporated by contemporary Scandinavian societies. What are
these objects and what about them can be considered ‘foreign’? In what contexts do we find them? How were they used (e. g. reworked)? Did they have influences on Scandinavian material culture? Using a biographical, contextual and relational approach, a
methodology is developed that challenges traditional propositions of dichotomous and static differentiations between ‘foreign’
and ‘own’, as well as simplistic interpretations of ‘foreign’ objects as prestige goods. Based on a detailed study of the objects
and their contexts, their handling in practice, a dynamic and relative understanding of foreignness allows a much more differentiated and accurate insight in to how Scandinavian societies of the Viking Age dealt with the tangible impacts of their cultural
encounters.
