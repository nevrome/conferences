findings reflects that it is not always the mobility of people, but often the mobility of ideas and traditions.
The most interesting is the discovery of a round fibula type IIB (by I. Jansson), found in a female burial. These fibulas are quite
traditional for Scandinavian women’s costume and are attached to garments. For example, such brooches are common for Birka
burials.
In the Podbolotje fibula was found in traditional Finno-Ugric burial. The costume and details do not differ from the indigenous
Murom funeral rite. Thus, this burial does not stand out among all other female burials. The pin and the clasp of fibula have traces
of several repairs and usage as a necklace. But in the grave it was located exactly where it should be – on the chest. Apparently,
the Scandinavian brooch was included in the funeral costume because it had a certain meaning, perhaps associated with the
status of the buried or with a consequence of the wider spread of the Viking world beyond the traditionally considered territories.
