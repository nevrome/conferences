Presentation Format: Oral
Human remains are excellent source for reconstruction the past life of ancient societies.
Questions addressed by anthropologists and archaeologists include the circumstances of the individuals’ death: Why and how
the individual died? Are there any traces of a possible violent act?
Interpersonal violence is a good indicator for further social reconstructions but signs of killing are not always visible and lesions
on the bones can often not be classified as traces of a violent act. Taphonomic changes and methodological difficulties during
the excavation as well as during the analyses might lead to misconclusions. Assassination weapons still stacked in bones for
example can be very good indicators for a killing scenario but are nonetheless rare cases. A series of examples of ancient killings
will be presented as well as unsolved cases. Some case studies are known from medieval Russia, including also slashed traumas.
Furthermore, examples of possible poisoning will be discussed.
It should be ruled out that especially interdisciplinary research on human remains as an independent source can provide important information on what might have happened in these ancient cases and whether we are dealing with a possible „crime scene“.
