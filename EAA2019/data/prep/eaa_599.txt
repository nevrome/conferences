this chronological period. Mostly, these are arrowheads, which location in the graves clearly indicates that the buried men were
wounded or killed. They were found in a neck, chest, spine, pelvis and legs. There are 16 burials of the Dnieper-Don Babino culture,
2 burials of the Volga-Don Babino, 2 burials of the Dnieper-Prut Babino, 3 burials of the Lola culture. It is interesting that overwhelmingly these arrowheads turned out to be other culturesâ€™ as opposed to burials where they were found. So according to the
arrows types we can trace the military conflicts between the representatives of the Volga-Don and Dnieper-Don Babino cultures
in the Volga-Don region where their areas were in contact. In Caucasus region, where the sites of Lola culture were located, the
arrowheads at the spine of one skeleton belonged to the Ginchy culture. Its area was the North-Eastern Caucasus. In turn, Lola
societies clashed with more northern Babino cultures. It was evidenced by Lola types of arrows in the backbone of neighbors.
Large military conflicts occurred during second part of the period under review. They were associated with the chariot cultures
expansion, that forced out the carriers of postcatacomb traditions in the southern and western directions. And there are a number of burials, first of all, of the Dnieper-Don Babino culture, where arrowheads of eastern neighbors are found in the skeletons.
