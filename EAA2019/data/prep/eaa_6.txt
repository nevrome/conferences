Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms
Organisers: Tys, Dries (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) - Citter, Carlo (Siena University)
Format: Round table
The position of Medieval Archaeology at universitary archaeology departments in Europe is currently not as flourishing as it used
to be 20 years ago. After a rise during the 80’s and mainly the 90’s, when medieval archaeology became a full-fledged subdiscipline of archaeology with everything this entails in terms of approaches, finalities, questions, methods, and developments, the
situation has deteriorated. In this round table we want to show the results of a small questionaire about the situation of medieval
archaeology in Europe and North America. The situation is different from country to country. On the one hand the situation of
medieval archaeology s still strong in UK, Scandinavia, the Low Countries, but it has weakened a lot in important countries such
as Germany, France and Spain. On the other had, Medieval Archaeology seems to be on the rise in eastern Europe. We want to
discuss these results with colleagues from all over Europe, discuss the causes of the difficulties, opportunities, projects and
more. we will enlighten you about the ‘medieval manifesto’ which is an initiative of MERC to define medieval archaeology in the
21st century.
