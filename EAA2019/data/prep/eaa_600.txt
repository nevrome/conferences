Excavation and interpretation of prehistoric multiple burials are challenge for both archaeologists and anthropologists. The comprehensive analysis of such sites can be entirely based on systematic recovery and on the application of specific analytical
methods due to the lack of written sources from this era. In our work we would like to reveal possible reasons and the processes
of formation of multiple burials in a certain historical period. A burial pit from the Copper Age recovered at Balatonszentgyörgy in
2017 was chosen as a starting point of a comparative analysis. The burial representing commingled remains with the minimum
number of 17 individuals witnessed a typical phenomenon of this era. In forensic science the study of taphonomic factors of
human remains within a mass grave or a multiple burial is a critical point to determine the disturbance and the nature of the grave
itself. In our case we would like to perform a complete assessment of the taphonomic parameters, and the funerary behavior
and study human remains with cross-referencing the anthropological data with the spatial and stratigraphic information. These
data will be compared with other contemporary sites to reveal differences and similarities regarding this special kind of human
activity.
