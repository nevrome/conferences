Presentation Format: Oral
The discovery of around 12.000 bones with numerous injuries as well as various weapon finds in the Tollense Valley in Northeast
Germany hint at an armed conflict of unusual scale dating to ca. 1300-1250 BC. Among the lesions, stabbing and projectile
traumas dominate. Funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) since 2017, the research project “Palaeomechanical investigations concerning the coherence of injury patterns and weapon efficiency on the basis of Bronze Age human bones and
weapons”, has engaged in the trauma analysis.
The injuries correspond to a range of late Bronze Age weapons found in the valley including wooden clubs and numerous flint and
bronze arrowheads. Digital microscopy, micro-CT imaging and digital weapon matching were carried out, to obtain information
about internal and external modifications of the bone structures caused by weapon related trauma as well as for the use-wear
analysis of the weapons.
Case studies, focusing on the characterization and differentiation of the wounding characteristics and the weapon efficiency,
demonstrate the benefits of high-resolution imaging and 3D-reconstruction combined with digital simulations of the mechanism
of injury.
The data thus obtained will be used for the development of diagnostic criteria for the differentiation of specific injury patterns.
With this suite of non-invasive methods we aim to help in reconstructing prehistoric interpersonal conflicts and also to exchange
data for the analysis of injuries with Forensic Science.
