During the renovation works inside the Church of San Giovanni di Prata in Pordenone (Pordenone, Italy) numerous floor graves
have been found, some of which were polysome. All the burials dated between the second half of the 13th century and the end of
the 14th century. The stratigraphical evidence and the historical-documental integration made it possible to identify that these
graves belonged to a Ghibelline family with a relevant territorial power: the Counts of Prata di Pordenone.
