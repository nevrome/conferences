The bioarchaeological analysis of the remains, referring to a total of 62 individuals, highlighted in a female subject a case of probable homicidal violence characterized by sharp force trauma in the right forearm, as defensive injuries, and cutting injuries in the
right orbit and in the right frontal bone. Furthermore, in a group of later graves, fatal lesions were found from edged and bladed
and throwing weapons, probably military ones. In particular, a male subject presented a large cranial wound by a crossbow dart,
whose metal tip was found in the burial.
