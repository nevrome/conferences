WRAPPING THE DEAD OVER THE CENTURIES: A FORENSIC MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO
UNDERSTAND POSSIBLE CRIMES

Presentation Format: Oral
Over the centuries, ”wrapped” bodies were buried in different contexts: cities, cemeteries, countrysides, houses, forests,
churches, etc. This was related to different reasons: ritual, worship, social status, etc. However, sometimes, this was necessary
to hide a ”crime scene”: violent death, homicide, tortures, etc. Even the ”wrapping” material could change depending on what you
wanted to conceal: fabric, bricks, concrete, lead, etc.
Although this habit is quite well known to law enforcement in modern crime scenes, it was not so obvious in the past. This work
presents some ”wrapped” scenarios of suspicious burials, assimilated to modern cases thanks to the use of new archaeological
surveys and analyses, such as 3D surface acquisition, GIS, GPR modelling, and stratigraphical excavation of the burial sites,
increasing the initial information value. New technologies allow to get more information on past killings and possible murder
practices and offer a better understanding of archaeological “wrapped crime scene”.
