Barrow group Fontan is one of the numerous burial sites in the Northern Black Sea area and the steppe regions of the European
Russia These sites are associated with the traditions of the Turkic tribes. Burials of this kind are well known and dated by XII-XIII
AD. Numerous grave goods are typical for this funeral rite. The location of the items is strictly defined and had not been disturbed
in our case. All accompanying objects (weapons, parts of the horse’s body) were placed on their original locus. The nomad was
buried according to all the traditions of the local tribe of that period.
The distinctive feature of this burial is the presence of an iron chisel in the area between the ischial bones. There were not visible
signs of damage on the ischium, pubic bones, and sacrum. The pelvis was oriented at the right angle to the body horizontal. Tibias, fibular bones and feet bones were located very close together. This circumstance indicates to the feet wrapping. All these
patterns add difficulties for the explanation of the reason why object appeared to be in the body. The photogrammetry allowed
to make a three-dimensional image of the skeleton in order to reconstruct taphonomy changes of the pubic bones position. The
body perimortem posture assumed as well. Presumably the cause of man’s death was a fatal incident. Its possible forms are
discussed in the presentation. Thus, the position of the metal object cannot be explained by ritual funeral actions.
