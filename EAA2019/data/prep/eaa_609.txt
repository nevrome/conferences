Presentation Format: Oral
Near Wiedemar in Germany, an extraordinary burial of a male person was documented in 2007. The skeleton was radiocarbon
dated to the late Iron Age (200-100 BC).
The skeleton was found directly underneath the top soil, in a pit which was too short and too shallow to be interpreted as a regular grave. Both arms were lying under the torso, and the skull was lying in a short distance to the left of the torso. The body was
probably also fully disjoined at midsection: a clear gap was observed between two lumbal vertebrae. The left leg was extremely
flexed, the right leg less severely so. The overall situation looked like as if the beheaded person was buried lying on his back in
a squatting-like position. Several bones show severe perimortem injuries. In combination with the manner of body disposal it is
suspected the victim was murdered.
All bones with trauma were 3D-scanned to assess the amount of single slashes and blows. All weapons marks were microscopically assessed to detect and document microtraces and maybe find further clues to determine the types of weapons used.
The results of all research methods as well as a suggested reconstruction of the sequence of events will be presented and
discussed.
