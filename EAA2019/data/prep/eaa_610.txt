How do we distinguish prehistoric violent deaths from each other? What is the difference between a ritualistic killing and a death
in warfare or a cold-blooded murder? This paper aims to discuss the human remains found in a bog in Everöd parish, southern
Sweden in 1866. The skeleton exhibits evidence of extreme violence in the form of multiple blunt force and sharp force injuries,
as well as signs of defleshing. The skeletal material has been radiocarbon dated to the Late Nordic Bronze Age (1100-500 BC).
The mode of the depositional practice of the human remains will be compared with other cases of violent death from the Nordic
Bronze Age and pre-Roman Iron Age, such as the ritual killings evident in bog bodies. Based on the anthropological investigation,
circumstances surrounding the killing and treatment of the individual who ended up in a bog in Everöd will be presented and form
the basis for a discussion regarding the type of death witnessed here. Is it an example of a society-sanctioned ritual, the result
of violence in warfare or a case of Bronze Age murder?
