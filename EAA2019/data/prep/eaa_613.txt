analysis of the recovered remains. Therefore, excavations are often performed in a rushed manner and the bones are reburied
without any form of anthropological examination. This is unfortunate, as the human remains often present various kinds of trauma and fractures, and even signs of medical interventions. In the cases where bodies can be identified, e.g. with their identification tags, observed injuries can be compared to the cause of death which was given to family members or which was listed in the
soldier’s military file. This paper presents several cases of observations made on German soldier’s remains recovered in France
and Croatia over the past years.
