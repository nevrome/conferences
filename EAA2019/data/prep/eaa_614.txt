CONCETRATION CAMP

Presentation Format: Oral
Forensic work in Spain has strived to become a tool for truth seeking, as national and local institutions have engaged with different politics of silence throughout the decades. Forensic experts have helped to elucidate the history and identity of thousands
of left-wing Republicans killed by Francoist groups. Their work has also revealed new empirical data about the functioning of distinct sites of terror that have remained elusive in the official paper trail and in the collective memory of some communities. This
is the case of the concentration camp located in the village of Castuera, in the region of Extremadura, which held over 20,000
detainees between 1939 and 1940. The Camp served new Francoist authorities to administer the large number of civil and military prisoners captured at the end of the war. It was also the site of numerous deaths due to disease, torture, hunger and/or execution. This presentation will examine, from a forensic perspective, the concrete ways in which archaeological findings compiled
during the excavation and exhumation of two mass graves contributed to the development of new historical facts about the
Francoist repression of political prisoners. Providing a detailed insight into the workings of the forensic method in the Spanish
context, I show how the scientific record becomes fundamental in deciphering the act of killing, the context of the execution, the
perimortem and postmortem treatment of prisoners, and the profiles of the executed and the perpetrator.
