In September 1939, during the battle of Zambrow, around 400 Polish soldiers fell to their deaths. Many of them remain unidentified and their graves are yet to be uncovered. Upon the request of the Mayor of Zambrow, the exhumation was performed in a
suspected multiple clandestine grave so as to identify and rebury one of the Polish soldiers, whose family was still waiting for
closure. During the exhumation process participated specialists from various disciplines: historians, archaeologists, geneticists
and an anthropologist. The main identification process was undertaken by scientists from the Pomeranian Medical University
and the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianisms. Two sets of skeletal remains were found in the grave, and the
study goal was to identify which of them belonged to a missing soldier. Anthropological analysis revealed that one skeleton
belonged to a person that was between 25-30 years old at the time of death, the other one was between 30-35 years at death.
Thus, anthropological analysis excluded one person from further molecular analyses, and the rest of the identification process
focused on the remains of the older person. The final molecular results showed that bones that belonged to a male 30-35 years
old are the bones of our missing soldier. This case shows that forensic anthropology may be of great importance in a positive
identification process even in cases that are nearly 80- years- old.
