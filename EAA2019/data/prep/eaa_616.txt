A case study of two subadults from the Northern Greek cemetery in Mavropigi Kozani, dated to the Roman period, showing evidence of perimortem cranial traumas is presented. Macroscopic and microscopic analysis was conducted, along with x-rays, in
order to eliminate the possibility of pseudopathology and examine the traumas for evidence of healing and cut marks. Sex assessment of the subadult individuals was conducted using a combined method, of dental measurements and the morphological
characteristics of the mandible and the pelvis. Age was estimated from the dental development and the stage of epiphyseal closure. One individual has a sharp force cranial trauma in a crescent shape, probably by a bladed weapon. The other has a penetrating, circular trauma on the frontal bone, probably by a projectile weapon. The traumas show no signs of healing. The two children
were closely buried in a cluster with five other individuals (two subadults and three adults) with no clear signs of interpersonal
violence. It is possible that the two children, if not all the individuals buried in the cluster, were the victims of a single violent
episode during the turbulent roman times in Macedonia.
