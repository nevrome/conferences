In the broad theoretical spectrum of archaeological ethnography, autoethnographic endeavors are generally scarce and, in
Greece, totally absent. The approach is considered at least controversial by the small group of academics and others who are actually acquainted with the term. The research combination of social and political issues with personal experiences, the emphasis
on the narrative form and the immediate address of the “researched-researcher”, deconstruct theoretical dualist oppositions of
art versus science or objectivity versus subjectivity and provoke fundamental epistemic principles.
Archaeological reality in Greece is complex, historically charged and always driven by national strategies. As such, describing
it is not an easy task. Experiencing it though, through the eyes of a contract archaeologist, has a high affective -and as such
scientific- impact that dictates its narration. Merging the ideas of (self-) reflexive critical inquiry with the notion of ”continuous
experience” as political intervention, I will attempt to comment on aspects of precariousness, exclusion and confrontation in
modern Greek archaeological reality, defined both by institutional settings, as well as tacit scientific notions and ideology: apprenticeship, manual labour, amateurism and at the same time professionalization of archaeology, are just some of contract
archaeologists assigned values that paralyze their social and scientific entity.
My autoethnographic attempt does not intent to represent Greek contract archaeologists as a unified social subjectivity, but
