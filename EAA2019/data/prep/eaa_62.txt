FROM DANDANKU TO CALCHAS: MILITARY RITUALS AS A CASE OF RELIGIOUS INTERACTION BETWEEN ANATOLIA AND GREECE

Among mechanism for cultural diffusion in the ancient world one of the most regular must have been war. War forces people into
close contact: think of the participants of the Battle of Qadesh. It also provides a motivation to keep up with the latest military
technology (e.g. horse-drive chariot warfare). In this paper I want to ask whether war could have been a context for the diffusion
between Anatolia and Greece in the LBA. The possibility of this arises because there was probably significant military contact
between Ahhiyawans and Hittites or W. Anatolians. I shall be focusing here on the diffusion of religious practice, particularly
military rituals.
In most, if not all, ancient cultures (e.g. Mesopotamia, Hittite Anatolia, Israel, Greece, Rome) warfare was to some extent ritualised (see e.g. Beal.1995; Kelle, Ames and Wright.2014; Ulanowski.2016). Rituals take place at the start a campaign or a battle, at
the end, and sometimes during the battle itself. The occurrence of similar rituals in neighbouring cultures may indicate borrowing,
or long term areal diffusion, though it may also be that they developed independently.
In the paper I shall consider a number of Hittite battle rituals which have parallels in Greek sources of the 1st millennium BC. The
most important of these is a class of W. Anatolian military plague rituals (e.g. Dandanku’s ritual “if there is a lot of dying in the
army”), which have similarities to the purification ritual performed by Calchas in Book 1 of the Iliad (Hazenbos.2007; Mouton and
Rutherford.2013). I shall assess the significance of such parallels by putting them in the general context of Mediterranean and
W. Asiatic military rituals.
