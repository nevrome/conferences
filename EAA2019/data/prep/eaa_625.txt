THE POLITICS OF WHAT WE KNOW
Author(s): Niculescu, Gheorghe Alexandru (The Vasile Pârvan Institute of Archaeology; The New Europe College)
Presentation Format: Oral
The empiricists, who claim value-free knowledge is attainable, and many of those who want an archaeology sensitive to current
political issues share a reflexivity deficit which makes them embrace, tacitly or openly, representations that are not products
of scientific research and have the authority of the political. The work on the history of the discipline during totalitarian regimes
shows what happens when political representations, not scientific theories, are at work, but that does not discourage those who
assemble theories by borrowing from prestigious intellectual sources, without inquiring about the reasons of their authority,
and employ them as something that cannot be changed by anything that archaeologists might find. Using, among others, Pierre
Bourdieu’s arguments for disciplinary autonomy and Andrew Abbott’s assessment of the relation between the empirical and
the normative in current sociological research, the paper will examine the political relevance of the research on ancient ethnic
phenomena and its uses.
An active involvement and an appropriate answer to those who expect from us something else than what they already know
should put the present into the perspective of our knowledge about the past, in discipline focused on what we can learn from the
research on material remains, not on recycling appealing theories. In order to achieve that, we have to avoid imagining the past
from the perspective of a present that is not a product of a scientific construction in which we are involved. And this becomes
possible by examining the choices that were made for us, in the local traditions of research in which we were educated, and the
relations between these and our own choices.
