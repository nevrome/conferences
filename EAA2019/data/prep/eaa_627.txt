deep-seated prejudices, and concepts of national identity, often themselves rooted in the archaeologies of earlier generations.
Invocations of such territorial boundaries frequently intersect with a sharpening of other social boundaries, dividing classes,

in these debates, archaeologists can position themselves at the borderlands, both metaphorically, and in their research foci.
Borderland narratives generally reveal the complexities of human interactions, and provide a rebuttal of simplistic ideas about
the permanence, and impermeability, of walls, fences, and hard borders. They show that, far from separating groups into ‘natu-
