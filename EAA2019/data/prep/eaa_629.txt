Currently, the rise of fascism in Europe and in the rest of the world is undoubted. However, democracies have kept alive the image
of fascism through heritage. And this is where we should discuss these heritage issues. Should fascist monuments be allowed?
Especially in consideration of the fact that fascism destroyed monuments from antifascist or other. Moreover, we must bear in
mind how Heritage protects these fascist monuments, and how this determines who History belongs to. From where is it written
books and landscapes, especially urban ones.
Nevertheless, there are some archaeologies developing against fascism, like anarchist archaeology, communist archaeology
and different research whose main perspective is critical of fascist ideologies.
This speech revolves around what is and is not considered heritage, and how much time has to pass for something to be considered heritage. Because nobody would dare to deny that the monuments of ancient Roman Empire are heritage. Nevertheless,
fascist monuments still hurt people’s sensibility. Did the monuments of ancient Roman Empire hurt ancient people sensibility?
Even though my main proposal is to talk about this heritage issue through different research of Spanish and Italian fascist monuments, I’d like to stimulate debate around these issues.
