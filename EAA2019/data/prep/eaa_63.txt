CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN PREHISTORY AT THE EAA25 TURN: RESEARCH ADVANCES AND NEW DIRECTIONS
Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms
Organisers: Dolfini, Andrea (Newcastle University) - Robin, Guillaume (University of Edinburgh) - Tafuri, Mary Anne (‘Sapienza’ University of Rome) - Iacono, Francesco (University of Cambridge) - Gori, Maja (Ruhr-Universität Bochum)
Format: Regular session
The Central Mediterranean is one of the most intensively researched regions of prehistoric Europe in subjects including, but not
limited to, landscape and environment, settlement patterns, exchange and mobility, technology and economy, life- and deathways, social complexity, and early urbanism. Recent discoveries and scientific analysis have furthered our understanding of its
material and social dynamics, but debate is often hindered by hyper-specialisation as well as disciplinary and country boundaries
discouraging comparative, cross-subject, and cross-period research. The session aims to take a ‘critical snapshot’ at prehistoric
studies in the region since the time of the first EAA meeting. We will discuss key disciplinary developments occurred in the last
25 years and capture the most innovative present-day research advances, which may shape the agenda of Central Mediterranean prehistoric studies in the next 25 years.
We invite doctoral students, early career researchers, and established scholars to submit papers discussing recent advances
and new directions in central Mediterranean prehistory from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age. The region ranges from the Southern
Alps to coastal Tunisia/Libya and from the eastern Adriatic/Ionian Seas to Sardinia, Corsica, and Provence. The papers should
offer broad, bold, and conceptually engaging perspectives in any subject of prehistoric studies, focusing on how research has
challenged established paradigms and interpretations, or how it is likely to challenge them in the future. Collaborative papers
cutting across traditional geographic, methodological, and period boundaries are especially welcome, as are those showing how
the regional dynamics affected other areas of prehistoric Europe and the Mediterranean. A parallel poster session will host contributions with narrower period and area foci.
