Throughout the history of the discipline, archaeologists have faced the challenge of disparate character of their record: remains
of human activities in the past, embracing both “cultural” and “natural” phenomena. Various responses have been devised, from
backing up archaeological inferences by the results gained from implementation of hard-science methods, to explicit embracing
of epistemological norms of natural sciences. More often than not, these strategies have tended to downplay the social/political
charge of archaeology, emphasizing the positivistic ideal of value-free knowledge. Furthermore, some recent theoretical arguments tend to flatten the ontology of humans and non-humans, with the aim of avoiding the nature/culture dichotomy and anthropocentrism of archaeology. It has been argued that the social engagement of the discipline is “flattened” at the same time.
The presentation aims to suggest that acknowledging the naturalistic concerns, or emphasizing the existence and materiality
of the world regardless of interaction with humans, need not (should not?) necessarily dampen the importance of social issues
in archaeology.
The example may be instructive of Peter Kropotkin (1842 – 1921), who observed the world not divided into nature/culture and
studied animals, plants, humans and their interactions. Contrary to Darwin and Spencer, who both emphasized competitiveness
and struggle, Kropotkin contended that the basic principle of survival is cooperation and that mutual aid has pragmatic advantages for the survival of both human and animal communities. His work is equally relevant today in the fields of biology, philosophy, ethics, politics and direct social action.
