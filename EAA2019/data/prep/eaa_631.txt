THE CENTRE CAN NOT HOLD

Archaeologists and heritage managers are finding themselves in a bewildering political landscape. It is the unsettled and unsettling landscape created by the ongoing seismic shifts in todayâ€™s world. The end of a well-known world-order and an ensuing flux,
in which a new order has yet to emerge and then coalesce, has repercussions felt at many scales of our lives.
How we experience the chaos obviously varies with who and where we are in the world. But most of us feel the strong pull away
from a center of common ground on which a social contract can build. A contract that allow us to negotiate our interests and
disagreements within a commonly accepted set of values and rules. Whether that social contract with its values and rules is (or
was) just, and fair is another question. The point is that its erosion is generating an almost fractal roadmap for people to follow in
their quest for identity and dignity.
The past has a particular role to play in this bewildering context. It may represent an (imagined) lost golden age, invoke memories
of injustices suffered, and fuel political projects that promise a bright future, while pitting people against each another. But it
may also help us better understand the chaos, by looking into other periods of shifting world order.
In this paper I will discuss conditions for navigating the fractured context and for offering meaningful interpretations of the past,
without contributing to stereotypes of backward-looking fundamentalisms (political and religious) or sterile political correctness.
