ARCHAEOLOGY: MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT
Author(s): Holtorf, Cornelius (Linnaeus University)
Presentation Format: Oral
I agree with the session abstract that archaeology in Europe must not be apolitical or atheoretical. A critical perspective is of
renewed significance today in the context of worrying links between cultural heritage and threats to the open society. However,
I would like to argue here that archaeological politics and theory are developing continuously, and that today they should be open
for new agendas and new forms, too. Of particular significance in contemporary society are questions of how archaeology can
contribute to global development, not the least in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations.
We therefore need an archaeological theory that helps us relate specific archaeological practice to concrete goals in global
societal development. Likewise, we need an archaeological politics that guides us in how to make a difference in society effectively. In the paper, I will discuss some relevant experiences from working in two different but related contexts, based on ongoing
collaborations with the nuclear waste sector and with UNESCO.
