THE LAKEBOS PROJECT: TRANSITIONS IN PREHISTORIC CATTLE HUSBANDRY IN SWITZERLAND

The Neolithic period was a time of transition across Europe. Domesticated livestock animals, including cattle, were introduced
and agricultural innovations spread across the continent. This spread is thought to have involved two dispersal routes: 1. along
the Danube corridor and through central Europe, and 2. around the Mediterranean littoral, resulting in a continental route focussed on cattle husbandry and a coastal route focused on caprines. These broad husbandry patterns became embedded in
these regions, and continued into the Bronze Age and beyond.
Switzerland is located in a pivotal position between the paths of these two routes, and the topography of the region, with the
Jura mountain range in the North and Alps to the south means that there is natural a corridor through which their influences
travelled and interacted. Additionally, it is also home to many well preserved and precisely dated prehistoric faunal assemblages,
recovered from wetland contexts, which provide a rare opportunity to study early European agricultural change in unprecedented
temporal detail. Cattle is the dominant domestic species in these assemblages, and has provided large datasets, suitable for
this kind of analysis.
The aim of the LAKEBOS project is therefore to use prehistoric Swiss cattle remains to investigate the spread and nature of
agricultural transitions in the area during this time. This paper will introduce the project and present some preliminary results.
