This research presents an integral part of a doctoral research, set within the EUROFARM project (Transmission of innovations:
comparison and modelling the spread of early farming and associated technologies in Europe), which studies the diffusion of
farming across the western Balkans in the 6th and 5th millennium cal. BC, integrating different kinds of associated technological
innovations: farming practices, landscape use, pottery and lithics. Production of chipped stone tools is one of the technologies
practiced by both late forager and early farmers, and therefore represents an ideal feature for investigating potential continuity/
discontinuity in lithic technology from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Neolithic, as well as during the entire Neolithic sequence.
Changes in stone tool production can be determined by technological and/or cultural choices, including raw material procurement and use, knapping techniques, morphometric traits of main technological categories, and retouched tools.
This paper aims to investigate the role of lithic technology during the spread and local development of farming across the
western Balkans (modern countries Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia), by assessing variability and/or
standardisation in lithic technology. Having in mind that pressure blade production and its accompanying knapping techniques
represent a key technological and cultural marker for identification of specialised production and mechanisms of technological
and/or cultural transmission, special attention was given to the blade debitage, quantifying variation in size of blades. An interdisciplinary approach including multiple conventional and analytical techniques from archaeology, materials science, geology,
and statistics is applied to the newly discovered and old museum lithic collections from the entire research area, which is also
supplemented by re-evaluation of the literature. This will allow to observe lithic technology in small-scale areas: within sites; and
within large-scale areas: geographical regions of the western Balkans.
