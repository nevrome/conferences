Land-use transitions may be linked with local historical processes on one hand, and with external influences such as trade and
human migrations on the other hand. Bronze Age Canaan represents a test case for studying land-use transitions and their causes. Geographically corresponding to the Southern Levant, Canaan was situated on the crossroads between physical and cultural
elements of Europe, Asia and Egypt. At the same time, local geographical diversity also provided a basis for intrinsic variation in
Canaanite agriculture and dietary preferences. Meanwhile, the plant-based Canaanite diet transformed over time, throughout
the Early to Late Bronze Ages, as evidenced by new archaeobotanical data. This included replacement of the dominant wheat
form, diversification of cultivated legumes, and increase in flax and grape production. In addition, the variation within the Canaanite diet that existed during the Early Bronze Age – between the western coastal plain and the eastern Jordan valley and Dead Sea
– becomes blurred towards the Late Bronze Age. We address the relationship between internal and external factors that may
correlate with these temporal and spatial changes, combining historical and environmental data.
