Agricultural history of the Southeast Baltic region developed in a way that was distinctively different from the more traditional
European Neolithic transition. Last several years in Lithuanian archaeology have been marked by a sharp increase in projects
focused on this topic. A reassessment and revaluation of existing archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evidence revealed
that while animal husbandry was adopted by the Neolithic inhabitants of the SE Baltic, there is a lack of any firm evidence on
farming predating the Bronze Age. Consequently, these studies have successfully challenged the concept of Neolithic farming
in the region and revitalised the old debate.
This paper explores the arrival of farming in the SE Baltic in the context of agricultural intensification which took place across the
Baltic Sea around the transition from the Early to Late Bronze Age. A recently excavated Kukuliškiai hilltop settlement in coastal
Lithuania has presented a significant addition to the existing archaeobotanical record. Assemblages from Kukuliškiai expands
our knowledge of the earliest crop packages and provides the earliest direct dates for several crop species in the region. New
data allows us to better understand the beginnings and development of farming in the SE Baltic. Finally, it allows to further examine the impact of this technology on the social and economic development of the local communities.
