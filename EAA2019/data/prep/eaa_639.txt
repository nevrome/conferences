Archaeozoological assemblages from the broader alpine region evidence remarkable changes in animal husbandry from the
Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Although cattle was economically the most important domesticated species in several Bronze Age
sites, pigs are found at relatively high percentages and in some cases they even prevail (e.g. mining sites). In contrast, Iron Age
bone assemblages indicate the clear dominance of cattle and in some cases of sheep/goat.
Current research explains these changes with the adaptation to general modifications in the socio-economic organisation of
the Iron Age alpine population: Between the 6th and 1st century BCE the latter was affected by processes of massive cultural
change: With the Fritzens-Sanzeno Culture emerging in today´s Tyrol and Trentino, a growing cultural impact of circumalpine Celtic societies and the expansion of Roman influence into the southern Alps, the mountainous region became both: cultural “melting
pot” as well as connecting link between Central Europe and the Mediterranean world.
The present study investigates the effect of this development on animal husbandry based on faunal assemblages from the
broader alpine region. In this regard, aspects of palaeoeconomy will be considered, based on faunal composition, reconstruction
of age and sex profiles and morphometric observations. Finally, the archaeozoological results will be combined with environmental studies and archaeological finds in order to examine processes that could have influenced these changes.
