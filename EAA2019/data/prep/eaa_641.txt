An overview of insect assemblages from different periods, from the Mesolithic onwards provides an understanding of the
changes with the introduction of agriculture and intensification on the landscape. Modified environments evidence changes in
biogeography, the origins of culture steppe and also of ecological imperialism in Europe. The Neolithic sees major changes in the
faunas of northern Europe with evidence for landscape clearance and modification which extends to the Bronze and Iron age.
Invasive species, primarily pests and ectoparasites from the Neolithic onwards, provide an understanding of the movement of
farming groups as they hitch a hike from one area to the other. These often depend on man made environments, which include
storage, for their survival and establishment and some may play a role in the transmission of infectious diseases which form part
of the package associated with mobility of human groups. Specific trends in the faunas associated with particular periods are indicative of human impact as a result of farming or pastoralism. From the Roman period, with the accidental movement of species
with the Roman army into new parts of the empire, the assemblages become more strongly synanthropic, as a culture steppe
develops. These changes are reflected in both rural and urban areas. From the medieval period onwards there is a geographic
expansion of introductions and a subsequent expansion of the spread of disease and biotic exchange and subsequently a loss
of biogeographic barriers. This pattern which starts in the Roman period continues up into the 19th century, where a transition
begins to more homogenised industrially farmed environments.
