Presentation Format: Oral
In early medieval times, a few settlements along the North Sea and Baltic regions show a development from small fishermen
settlements to a more complex community of inhabitants who are not only involved in fishing, but in other activities as well. Information related to these coastal sites are crucial to delineate their local specificities and common features, which subsequently
gives the opportunity to find differences or similarities with more rural and urban settlements. The results of the zooarchaeological study of Domburg reveal an exciting look inside this coastal community, also known as Walcheren. The statistical data of
livestock assemblages shows similarities to the other complex North Sea communities. However, the report also indicates some
differences in the treatment of animal bones. Cutting marks, specific choices of bone as raw materials and the presence of birds
of prey, figure as relics of their daily activities. Through typological and microwear analyses, artefacts as combs, flutes and pins
display their connection to the broader trade network of the North Sea basin. The results of this research therefore reinforce the
assumption that Domburg was part of the network of complex trading sites along the North Sea.
