Phenotypic changes in domestic animals, often indicate changes in the nature of animal husbandry, such as the introduction of
new individuals into a population. A classic example of this is the widespread increase in the size of cattle at the transition from
the Iron Age to the Roman period, and the subsequent decrease from the Roman to Medieval period. This pattern can be seen at
Swiss sites, as well as across many other European areas.
We monitored ancient mitochondrial d-loop diversity in cattle from Swiss assemblages from the Iron Age (Basel Gasfabrik, Basel Martinsgasse), Roman (Augst/Kaiseraugst: Theater Nord-Westecke, Hotel Adler, Kastelen, Insula 23) and Medieval (Reinach
Brunngasse, Lausen) periods. Cattle belong to the taurine macro-haplogroup T3, two Roman cattle individuals belong to haplogroup T2 and one Medieval cattle to haplogroup T1, the later has a mainly African distribution today. We find that genetic diversity correlates roughly with size fluctuations. We will discuss the evidence within its archaeological/archaeozoological context.
