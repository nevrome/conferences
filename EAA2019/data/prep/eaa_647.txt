Presentation Format: Oral
The application of archaeological sciences to the investigation of agricultural changes in historical times is still a relatively new
approach. In particular, projects aimed at researching changes in animal husbandry during the Post-Roman period have become
more common only recently, often using one line of evidence (i.e. zooarchaeological evidence) or, less often, combining different
types of evidence (i.e. archaeological and historical sources).
