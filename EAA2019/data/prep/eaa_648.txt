In this presentation, we will reflect on the potential and limitations of the zooarchaeological discipline (in combination with other
evidence, for instance historical sources and isotopic analysis) to explore topics such as agricultural improvement, productivity,
specialized economy and subsistence economy, based on the personal experience of having researched two major transitions
in human history: from Roman to Medieval times, and from Medieval to Modern times. In order to do so, two different research
projects will be briefly presented and discussed. One of them was developed between 2015 and 2017, aimed at understanding
changes in animal husbandry between the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period in Spain and in England. The other project, called ZooRoMed, is now in its beginning, and will investigate changes in animal husbandry between Late Roman times and
the Early Middle Ages in the Rhine Valley.
