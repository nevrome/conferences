The impact of the medieval Arab expansion during the 7th and 8th centuries on agriculture –a process famously coined as the
‘Arab Green Revolution’ by Watson in 1974– implied the introduction and/or diffusion of new forms of agriculture that transformed the local economies across the Middle East, North Africa, Iberia and several of the Mediterranean islands. Furthermore,
the subsequent conquest of these Islamic societies by Christian forces saw the adoption of these innovative agricultural systems and technologies, alongside the incorporation of conquered Muslim populations.
The aim of this paper is to show how the increasing importance of the role played by archaeological techniques such as bioarchaeology (archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, biomolecular analysis), geoarchaeology and landscape archaeology has contributed
to our understanding of agricultural transitions during this period, focusing on socioeconomic, cultural and political dynamics.
This presentation is mainly concerned with Iberia as this area has seen a remarkable increase in new archaeological evidence
that has emerged during the last few years and is also focus of novel multidisciplinary research projects that aim to examine the
ecological impact of Islamic and subsequent Christian regimes across the Iberian mainland and Balearic Islands.
