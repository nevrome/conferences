In the last decade shells as tools have been repeatedly identified in the archaeological record. Malacology assemblages were
traditionally studied for paleoecology and for reconstruct dietary behaviours of past community. Technological approach and
microscopic study for use-wear analysis showed that shells were used as raw material along Mediterranean coasts since Middle
Palaeolithic. The understanding of the socio-economical value of these items and the study in evolutionary perspective analysing Neanderthal and Anatomically Modern Humans behaviours is a work-in-progress that has in-depth implications in the understanding of when coastal adaptations appeared. Furthermore, variations in coastal lifestyle allows addressing central topic in
ancient Prehistory: dispersal routes, seasonal movements, and emergence of complex behaviours. However, several aspects
are still few investigated. First of all a definition of ‘coastal adaptation’ is lacking; secondly, taphonomic bias is still few understood; and finally, a reliable chronological framework is needed. In this communication, we present the current knowledge of
coastal occupation in Mediterranean regions along ancient Palaeolithic, especially focusing in subsistence and in the use of
shell for functional aims in European Middle Palaeolithic and African Middle Stone Age. Furthermore, we discuss the implication
of these data in the study of human evolution. Finally, we present perspectives of this research line according to recent studies
that we are developing to solve some of the themes still pending of being investigated.
