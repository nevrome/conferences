Today over 120 million hectares are devoted to rice agriculture in South Asia. This major crop is cultivated in diverse strategies,
ranging from low yield and low investment dry rice, to the intensively managed, high yielding irrigated paddyfields, with differing
implications for greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide. It is a staple grain with great ecological, cultural,
and nutritional value. However, the different growing ecologies demand very different levels of input and knowledge, thereby
having profound implications for social organisation and agricultural strategy. Archaeologically, we begin to see a transition to
wet rice agriculture in South Asia from c. 1000 BC from charred crop and weed remains. However, issues of preservation and
recovery of crop weed remains persist, and a majority of excavations in the region do not employ adequate flotation techniques.
