Here we present evidence for the direct stable isotope analysis of the archaeological grain itself to glean information about
growing ecologies, including strategies of manuring and water management. We apply the method to archaeological remains
to sites in South Asia spanning time periods of increasing urbanisation, from the 2nd millennium BCE to the 5th century CE. Our
data demonstrate the potential of stable isotope analysis of the grain to elucidate major transitions in crop management, social
organisation, and environmental conditions within the varied ecological landscape of South Asia.
