Presentation Format: Oral
A dramatic increase in the population of England occurred between the Saxon and medieval periods, alongside economic growth,
an increase in urban living and widening social hierarchies. This transition required an expansion of cereal cultivation that culminated in the widespread application of open field farming to facilitate the production of enough food to sustain the increasing
population. The Feeding Anglo-Saxon England (FeedSax) project combines analysis from animal bones, seeds, pollen, isotopes
and radiocarbon dating to inform the nature of this transition. Did it come about as a wholesale ‘package’ of social and agricultural
change, or was it a case of piecemeal technological uptake as the local conditions necessitated?
As the second year of the project approaches, preliminary results are emerging, as well as a better idea of how the various
strands of research will come together. This presentation aims to provide some early data regarding animal husbandry, cereal
cultivation, geographical variation in settlement archaeology, agriculture and land use.
One of the strengths of the project is the co-operation of researchers from related but varied disciplines. This is an increasingly
common approach as the benefits of cross-discipline enquiry are realised. An overview of the nature of the relationship between
these specialists and how the integration of data works within the project will also be presented to provoke a conversation about
the ways that it has been implemented on similar projects, and how it can be improved or facilitated better in the future.
