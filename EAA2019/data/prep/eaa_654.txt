THAT IS NEW, WHAT IS IT CALLED? COLLAR?

One of the big transitions in agriculture was the invention of the collar. A horse is not really build for a yoke like a cattle but they
were also put to the twin yoke, recognizable by its big cavities for clasping the ribs of the horse. The Cattle yokes either rest on
the neck, on the forehead or in the front of the withers, for this reason cattle yokes have not big cavities. All types of twin-yokes
have been known since the Neolithic and each design has its pros and cons. The only single cattle yoke known until now comes
from Pforzheim (Roman-Period) and is a single yoke for the withers.
The only known single horse yokes (roman-time) occur in the shape of an iron bow, which rested on upper side of the neck. Its
counter piece could have been a well padded semi-collar or a breast girth. With the collar the horse power is used more efficient
because the draught power of the horse is in the upper part of the shoulder exactly where the collar is pressed to the horse
shoulder. The horse is faster then a catttle and with a good fitting collar more work can be done.
The speed and carrying capacity of the animals are different and in some cases remarkable. The efficiency of animals always
depends on their health condition.
