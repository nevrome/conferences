PIG AND LIVING SPACE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LATRINE USE IN EAST ASIA
Author(s): Kim, Geon Young (Seoul National University)
Presentation Format: Poster
Pottery made latrines that consist of a human latrine on the upper floor and a pigsty below are one of the most common funeral
objects found in East China since the late 2nd century before the common era. Some contemporary dwelling sites also reveal a
division of living space during the Han and later dynastic periods, suggesting a possible use of human and domesticated animal(s)
faeces as fertilizer. Compared with its neighbour where the living space planning was relevant to the reuse of human wastes for
agricultural purpose, not until the late dynastic period did the Korean peninsula show waste management space in a dwelling that
is related to animal husbandry and agricultural use. Considering the distinct aspect of animal husbandry in the Korean peninsula,
based on artefacts that reveal domestic living space management, historical records including agricultural books, along with
human/ fauna remains and soil analysis, this poster discusses the possible relation between living space division modification
and changes in cattle husbandry and agricultural practice.
