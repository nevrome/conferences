The materials of archaeological cultures dated to 6200-5300 cal BC contented the bones of wild animals. Nevertheless upper
cultural layers on these sites comprised the bones of wild animals together with domestic sheep bones. The lipid analysis of food
crusts from pottery supported the presence of milk products. According to radiocarbon analysis the transition to domestication
can be dated about 5200 cal BC. The paleoclimatic indicators mark this time as wet conditions of climatic maximum of Holocene
which set in after the strong climatic aridization. In this period in forest steppe zone according to pollen analysis a motley grass,
cereals, Chenopodiaceae were spread. On the data of phytolith analysis the traces of domestication inside of settlement did not
registered. Technical analysis of pottery showed the combination of local and alien traditions of ceramic technology. This can
be traced in changes of vessel shapes, manner of ornamentation and compositions. The sharp changes in using of different raw
sources can be observed on the stone tools: flint was changed on quartzite. Technology of stone tools was changed drastically
with appearance of reinforced stone technique. The big scrapers, knives, points, arrows had a new shapes and were made from
massive wide spall. This is evidences of a crisis of the local culture with appropriating economy during a strong climatic aridization and the transition to another type of economy. We suggest the transition to domestication in the Lower Povolzhye region
connects with appearance of carriers of new culture from the Lower Don territory. Probably the migration was triggered by drastic climatic changes from region of worse climatic conditions to region of better environment. The first outcomes of transition to
domestication for local aborigines are not significant.
