As much as it is today, in prehistory the Balkan region was the main route of communication between the cultures of the Near
East and those of Central Europe. Moreover, given its location at the intersection of these two large and diverse worlds, this region itself often acted as a source of major cultural advances and innovations. However, research on the prehistory of this part of
Europe has not been carried out in a way that corresponds to the culture-historical significance of the region. There are multiple
reasons for this, of both general and fundamental character. Namely, it is evident that the study of prehistory, even today still
suffers from teething troubles caused by its initial antiquarianism, as well as by its over-dependence on coincidence and other
exogenous factors.
No other discipline is determined by external issues to such a degree as is archaeology. Let it suffice to mention the fact that
very important archaeological finds are usually not discovered by archaeologists, but by amateurs and farmers in fields. Further,
the direction of archaeological investigations is generally not defined by scientific reason, but by cultural, political and economic
interests, including tourism and construction activity. Hence, one consequence is the lack of systematic research strategy.
This inevitably leads to a poorly argued scientific synthesis, which has to be corrected every few years, or completely rejected.
