IN THE GORGES OF THE BALKANS: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPES

Presentation Format: Oral
Middle- and high-altitude landscapes are often viewed as marginal areas in Balkan archaeology. Excavations in many parts of the
peninsula have traditionally concentrated on the larger and well-stratified sites in the lowlands, and the intensity of fieldwork
is still significantly higher in the valleys and plains. Yet mountainous landscapes are a dominant feature in the geography of
the Balkan Peninsula, and research in other parts of Europe has shown how an “upland” outlook can significantly advance our
understanding of local and supra-regional developments. In this contribution, I briefly summarise previous research on the prehistory of middle- and high-altitude landscapes in the Balkans. I also present several examples of interdisciplinary approaches to
the archaeology of upland and mountainous areas in other parts of Mediterranean and Alpine Europe, to illustrate the potential
of upland sites as a subject of field- and laboratory-based archaeological research. These examples deal with questions such
as agro-pastoral pressure on mountain palaeoenvironments, woodland management, complementarity of highland and lowland
settlement systems, recognition of past mobile pastoral economies, high mountain agriculture, and sedentary ys mobile settlement forms. They combine methodologies of archaeology and the archaeological sciences, including ethnoarchaeology, isotope
analysis, and palaeoenvironmental studies.
