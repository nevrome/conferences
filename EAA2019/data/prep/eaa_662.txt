SANDANSKI-PETRICH BASIN OF SOUTHWEST BULGARIA

The Sandanski-Petrich Basin is situated between the Serbo-Macedonian and Rila-Rhodope Massifs in the Middle Struma River
Valley of Southwest Bulgaria. Settled during the Early Neolithic Period by approximately 6200 cal BC, the occupation of Sandanski-Petrich represents one of the first instances in which early agricultural practices were transferred from the North Aegean
towards the more temperate environmental conditions of the interior Balkan Peninsula. To date, a comprehensive series of archaeological surveys have identified six Early Neolithic, eighteen Middle Neolithic, and seventeen Late Neolithic settlements.
Notably, the earliest settlements are all geographically confined to the foothills of the Pirin and Ograzhden Mountains, whereas
valley bottom settlements do not appear until comparatively later during the Late Neolithic Period. The latter therefore stands
in stark contrast to the oft-cited hypothesis that the neolithization process of Southeast Europe was primarily driven by a leapfrog distribution of early agricultural settlements in the fertile valley floodplains of the major river systems (Davison et al. 2006;
Gimbutas 1991; Sherratt 1980). In this paper I argue to the contrary that the geography and climate of the Sandanski-Petrich
Basin was more conducive to the establishment of small-scale farming villages in the foothills and that such settlements would
have been primarily reliant on rainfed agriculture and animal husbandry for their subsistence. Furthermore, I demonstrate how
these uniquely regional characteristics contributed to the emergence of a localized identity in the Sandanski-Petrich Basin that
lasted all throughout the Neolithic Period. In conclusion, I emphasize that the archaeology of mountainous landscapes is far more
important with regards to the neolithization process of Southeast Europe than has to date been recognized.
