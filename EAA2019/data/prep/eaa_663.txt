The primary and secondary copper deposits of the Medni Rid highland in south eastern Bulgaria close to Burgas have been mined
extensively over the last centuries. LiDAR data has been used to identify targets for ground thruthing of geoarcheological and
montane archeological interest as well as archeological settlement remains. The localization of prehistoric mines has been aggravated due to intense reworking and overprinting by mining activities from the antique to communist times. Up to now, over
80 findspots – including ore deposits, traces of partially fortified settlements, burial mounds and metallurgical smelting spots
– have been found and documented.
During a rescue excavation led by P. Leshtakov (Sofia), amongst others remains of ore, crucibles and slagged pottery were found
in Chalcolithic layers of the excavated settlement Akladi Cheiri between Chernomorets and Sozopol. These finds indicate an
early metallurgical use of copper during the 5th millennium BCE. The evidence of metallurgical ability shows, at least indirectly,
an easily recognizable chain of metallurgical activity, beginning with ore extraction through to the production of the artifacts
themselves.
It seems that the raw material deposits Medni Rid are the first that were exploited for green minerals and even for copper production from the transition from the 6th to the 5th millennium BCE. Neighbouring settlements such as Akladi Cheiri, Budzhaka and
Alepu as well as Hadzhidimitrovo and Dana Bunar 2 used the easily accessible copper ores, which must have been exposed to the
