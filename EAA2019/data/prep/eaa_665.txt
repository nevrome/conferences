One of the main characteristics of the Copper Age in the south-eastern Europe is the collapse of the larger settlements (tells) that
were settled over longer period and the appearance of small short-lived settlements. The causes of these changes are probably
of economic and social reasons, and they have occurred most likely due to changes in living conditions (the appearance of a more
dry climate), and technological innovations (e.g. Bánffy 1995, 183-187; Bánffy 2010). In the studying area, north-eastern Slovenia, however, there is very little known about the prior Neolithic settlement system, because a larger amount of settlements
appear for the first time in the following period, in the second half of the 5th millennium BC. These settlements belong to the
Lasinja culture, which was distributed at the beginning of the Copper Age in Austria, western Hungary, through northern Croatia
and Bosnia, and coincides with the similar and related cultures distributed at the central Balkans (Krivodol-Sălcuţa-Bubanj-Hum1
complex). The topic of this paper is the evaluation of the background of the aforementioned changes in the second half of 5th
millennium BC in north-eastern Slovenia, based on analysis of the material culture in the region and beyond by a multi-analytical
approach. It has been known for a long time that connections with the central Balkan region have played an important role in the
formation of a new cultural groups in the south-eastern Alps and in Western Pannonia at the beginning of the Copper Age (Bánffy
1994; 1996; 2002). However, new systematic analysis gave us further data for a better understanding of these connections.
