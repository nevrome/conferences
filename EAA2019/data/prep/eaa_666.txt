Presentation Format: Oral
The Cetina phenomenon is still being investigated mostly focusing on its Mediterranean dimension. Yet, in its core area Cetina
sites are not coastal, rather they flourished inland of the karst environment of central Dalmatia, dominated by the Dinaric Alps
ridges interspersed by fertile plans. The actual geographic extension of Cetina core area has yet to be clearly understood. At
present, the Velebit massif appears somehow to mark a border (though permeable) towards the north. On the eastern and southern side, however, the Bosnian and Montenegro ridges do not seem to have constituted obstacles for social interactions and
shared cultural traits.
The main source of information on Cetina culture in Dalmatia is still the distinct pottery coming from funerary contexts and
caves, while we lack data from settlements and more generally on the socio-economic organisation of these communities.
Nonetheless, it is time to start working on socio-economic models and patterns of interactions, also in order to develop a new
research agenda.
In this presentation we will suggest possible socio-economic models for Cetina groups and discuss the role of mountainscapes
as both economic and cultural resources for these communities. Cetina communities were likely prone to short-range and longrange mobility and they shaped their own landscape through the building of funerary tumuli. The geographic dimension and the
changing role of mountains as connecting/ disconnecting elements will be also addressed.
