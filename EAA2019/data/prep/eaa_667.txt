Since recent the end of the third millennium BC in southern Balkans was poorly known as its chronological and cultural definition was largely based on loose pottery typology. The chronology of the Armenochori cultural group, indeed, has always posed
somewhat of a problem, and it was considered as an isolated phenomenon in the Balkan and Aegean Bronze Age. Although based
on limited evidence, new absolute dating of the Armenochori cultural group suggests that it can be tentatively divided into two
partially overlapping phases that span the entire second half of the third mill. calBC (Bulatović, Gori & Vander Linden 2019). In the
last quarter of the 3rd millennium calBC an expansion of Armenochori features from central Macedonia towards the north along
the upper stream of the South Morava River, the west across the Dinaric Alps, and the south towards the Chalkidiki Peninsula
can be assumed. Likewise, advancement in absolute dating and archaeological research on the Dalmatian Cetina phenomenon
(Forenbaher 2018; Gori, Recchia & Thomas 2018) suggests a chronology for this group that encompasses the entire second half
of the 3rd mill. BC, and a tentatively division into two phases (Recchia & Cazzella 2017). Armenochori and Cetina groups have
been always considered as two distinct and detached cultural entities that never interacted. However, by looking at absolute
dating combined with data from new and old excavations an interaction between the Cetina and the Armenochori groups can
be traced at the end of the 3rd mill. cal BC. Interaction seems to have occurred mainly in the mountainous region connecting
Macedonia to Dalmatia, where transculturation between these two groups can be observed in ceramics from both graves and
