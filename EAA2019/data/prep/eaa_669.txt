During the Early Bronze Age in the hinterland of the East Adriatic coast a culture was born – Cetina Culture – characterised by
stone tumuli. Richer tumuli were equipped with burial goods including decorated pottery. This decorated Cetina pottery had a
wide distribution: associated groups have been found in Albania and Italy, but also Malta, the Peloponnese and the Saronic Gulf.
In brief, Cetina Culture was a phenomenon that by far surpassed its original habitat along the eponymous river.
Stone tumuli are still visible scattered on mountain slopes surrounding the Cetina river valley. Their position gives an impression
that they were meant to oversee the valley. No traces of settlements have been found in the immediate vicinity of tumuli, which
is not surprising considering that this mountainous landscape is mostly karstic. However, within the valley itself hillforts can
be visually spotted, sitting on top of small hills above the river. Fields along the river were occasionally inhabited as well (pile
dwelling settlements). The paper discusses the spatial relationship between tumuli and the areas where contemporary settlements would have been. It will be argued that the position of tumuli, somewhat distant and elevated from the settlements, had
a symbolic meaning: the dead members of the community were looking over still living ones and protecting them, which in turn
gives the overall landscape of the Cetina valley a powerful symbolic message. This interplay between the tumuli and the river
with accompanying settlements will be presented through several case studies.
