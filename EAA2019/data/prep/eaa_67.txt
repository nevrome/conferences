Recent advances in the study of Early Neolithic to Copper Age archaeological complexes in the Central Mediterranean, and in particular in the Adriatic Basin and the connected seascapes, has led to substantial reappraisals of their chronological frameworks
and socio-economic interrelationships. Entities such as the Impresso Cardial Complex (ICC) and the complexes of polychrome
pottery or incised and stamped pottery manifest as supra-regional phenomena that can be understood as networks of communication, often also taking the function of networks of raw material supply and distribution. Obsidian is an evident, albeit complex
tracer of supra-regional networks, and so is flint, with the advantage that it is ubiquitous and multifunctional. The Gargano flint
deposits and mines have been a focus of interest for many years, yet their importance as the major center of flint supply in
southern Italy and the Adriatic basin in the Neolithic and Copper Age has only recently been recognized, thanks to the possibilities of tracing flint provenance and distribution by micro-facial analysis. Beyond the identification of sources and the mapping
of occurences, a series of technological and socio-economical questions arise, relating e.g. to economic settings of production,
flint working traditions and/or styles, and formats of distribution (blanks, tablettes, preforms). The long-term objective of such
an approach is a systemic understanding of raw material circulation, to which we contribute elements of recent research on
producer and consumer sites.
