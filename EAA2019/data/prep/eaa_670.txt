Presentation Format: Oral
Mountains in history and archaeology were concerned more as obstacles and barriers then as a spaces of connection and interaction. Last two decades I conducted and participated in numerous research campaigns in Croatian mountains, especially
Velebit, Kapela and Biokovo. In this paper I will present the results of previous campaigns but more our dilemmas and questions
on prehistory and antiquity of those complex ecosystems. The images of mountains and their inhabitants given by narratives
of written sources from Antiguity to Early Modern and Modern age and its confrontation with data of spatial and environmental
analysis and studies of material culture also will be a part of this contribution. In June and July we will have in the National Park
Northern Velebit a 5th Croatian-American field school (University of Zagreb, University of Wyoming, University East Oregon,
Ministry of Culture and Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb). The goal of recent research of our field school is understanding of
communication systems, interaction landscape - human society. In this paper we will present recent results of our work.
