EARLY AND MIDDLE BRONZE AGE?

In the first half of the second millennium BC, the Istrian peninsula emerges as a coherent cultural space, which is characterized
by Gradinas, fortified hilltop settlements with circular walls built in dry-stone technique, and a very specific pottery. The rough
karst landscape of the peninsula was inhabited especially in the western part in the coastal areas, the mountainous central and
northeastern part show a lower population density. Influences of the Istrian peninsula respectively the integration into the same
cultural space are particularly evident in the spread of the specific pottery in the area of the Trieste karst on the one hand and
in the area of the Kvarner Bay on the other. In particular, the appearance of comparable material culture on the Kvarner islands
speaks for a lively exchange in the context of a communication network by sea. The situation is markedly different in the hinterland of the Primorsko-notranjska region of south-western Slovenia and in the Primorje-Gorski kotar county in north-western
Croatia, which are bordering on Istria. Comparable ceramics are hardly known here. The question arises whether this is merely a
desideratum of research or whether the Učka massif in the north-east of the Istrian peninsula formed a geographic and cultural
boundary during the developed Early and Middle Bronze Age?
