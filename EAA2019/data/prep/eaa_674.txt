The paper will focus on recent investigation of several Late Bronze Age (13th- 9th century BC) hilltop sites in the mountainous
area of central Bosnia. Typical for landscape of this region are 2000-meter high mountains of Dinaric Alps and smaller river valleys and basins, building up a perfect scenery for a micro regional research approach within one specific area, determined by
the geography and landscape. The area chosen for a detailed study is located in the Basin of Bosna River near city of Zenica.
Conspicuous for this micro region are several fortified plateaus on high (700-900 Meter), prominent positions with an ability
to oversee most of the lower areas. Additionally, all of the fortified plateaus are in a direct mutual visual contact to each other.
While the surface finds indicate that plateaus were permanently occupied, the geophysics, air- borne scanning and excavations
conducted in 2018 und 2019 seek to reveal the real nature and background of these extraordinary sites.
