The paper touches upon the issue of amber inflow to the Central Balkans and its circulation between individual regions situated
in this zone, during later stages of the Bronze Age (more specifically around 1600-900 BC). In the past several authors have
discussed the possibility of Morava – Vardar valleys being used as an amber trade route connecting the Carpathian Basin with
the Balkan interior, and further south with the Greek mainland. Nonetheless, most have concluded that there is not enough evidence for a steady use of this trail in such capacity. Furthermore, the inherent features of the Balkan landscape were deemed
unfavourable for the movement of goods and people, thus the latter must have been intermittent rather than regular. Growth of
data related to this subject in the recent years prompts to reconsider it with application of previously unused methods. Hitherto documented amber finds were classified typologically, and subsequently analyzed in temporal and spatial dimensions, with
seriation and correspondence analysis respectively. Observations stemming from these statistics were subsequently used in
the network analysis, quantifying similarities between regionally grouped amber finds. The considerations on amber were supplemented with typo-chronological analysis of selected artefacts, co-occurring with amber at find-spots. The results shed a
light on internal dynamics of amber circulation, and allow to pin point main recipients and potential exchange participants. Which
routes exactly were most likely used by travellers – merchants is up for debate, however it can be concluded that during certain
periods in the 2nd mil. BC goods moved meridionally across the Central Balkans, and amber undoubtedly was one of them.
