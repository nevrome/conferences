Presentation Format: Oral
The discovery of the up to now only known gold mine of the European prehistory in the Rhodopes (southeast Bulgaria) opens
new perspectives on the old discussions about Aegean-Balkan contacts in the Late Bronze Age. Through the modern excavation
of the site (by H. Popov Bulgarian Academy of Science NIAM-BAS), a number of new data are available to reassess the relations between Mediterranean civilizations and their periphery. In order to gain a better understanding of the socio-economic
entanglements, a comparative analysis of the local and everyday practices of the gold miners is made in relation to those of
adjacent regions. The presentation will focus on selected aspects of the researcher’s doctoral thesis, which is dealing with the
settlement of the gold miners, and is embedded in the project “Bronze Age Gold Road of the Balkans - Ada Tepe mining” (led by B.
Horejs, Austrian Academy of Science OREA Institute, founded by the FWF, project no. P28451). While the previous debates on
Aegean-Balkan contacts were mainly based on prestige goods, there is now a rational and economic reason that could explain
the connections. It sheds a new light on the complexity and multidimensionality of the Late Bronze Age contact and interaction
networks between the Balkans and Greece, which worked simultaneously at different socio-economic levels.
