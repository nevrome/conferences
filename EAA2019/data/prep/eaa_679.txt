Macedonia is a country covered predominantly with mountains. During the prehistory, inhabitation regions changed, but mostly
inhabited were the valleys. Change is noticed during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age when the burial mounds started to be
used on the territory of today’s North Macedonia. The largest concentration of this type of burial is in higher altitude regions
bordering the plains and valleys, such as Mariovo, a mountainous area rising above Pelagonia plain. It represents the most significant Macedonian region in prehistory and even later. Reason for this situation is still unknown for the archaeologists but several
points have been made concerning the landscape and social structure of the communities that were using burial mounds.
The primary goal of the paper is to investigate and to present the potential of these hilly and mountainous regions and certain
mounds but also to emphasize the importance of incorporating some of the non-destructive methods into further study of the
phenomenon. They could contribute to pointing out some other research possibilities contrary to the traditional study of material culture, which has not yet yielded some specific results.
Thus one of the biggest problems that Macedonian archaeologists are currently dealing with is the lack of information about the
spatial distribution of these specific types of burials and their connection to the concurrent settlements, but also insufficient
financial means, the use of non-destructive methods and analyses (GIS, archaeological remote sensing, statistics and so on) is
considered inevitable.
This paper brings the first information about a doctoral project solved at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice,
Czech Republic.
