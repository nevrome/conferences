VALLEYS DURING THE IRON AGE

Presentation Format: Oral
A substantial part of the Macedonian region is comprised by the course of the Vardar/Axios River, which links broad valleys separated from one other by formidable mountain ranges, including the Demir Kapija, also known as the Iron Gate of Macedonia. Demir
Kapija marks a climatic and geological barrier that separates the Lower Vardar Valley, characterized by a sub-Mediterranean climate, from the continental sub-Mediterranean climate of the regions situated to the north. During the period of the Early Iron
Age, the gorge and the surrounding mountains seem to have had an impact on the differentiation of cultural landscapes, which
is reflected in the distinct material culture and ideologies, separating groups from the Lower and Upper Vardar and Bregalnica
Valleys. In the past, this differentiation led to the description of various archaeological ‘cultural groups’ within the Macedonian
region. The aim of the paper is to re-examine the criteria by which this distinction was once made as well as to evaluate the
possible impact that the natural conditions might have had on the cultural landscape by focusing on interactions and underlying
processes. One criterion for the regional differentiation relies on pottery styles, which gives precedence to the manufacturing
techniques rather than commonality of shapes. However, areas to the north and the south of the Demir Kapija share the ’jug with
a cut neck’, a shape in both a handmade and a wheelmade variant. Thus, by looking at this type of pottery and by discussing the
burial customs as well as precious portable goods like the so-called ‘Macedonian bronzes’, this contribution will identify which
aspects of the material culture and connected ideologies and beliefs circulated only locally and which aspects linked regions to
the north and the south of the mountainous barrier of Demir Kapija.
