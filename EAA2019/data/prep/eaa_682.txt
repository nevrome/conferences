Friuli Venezia Giulia, in north-eastern Italy, includes an extremely heterogeneous territory, which extends from the Adriatic coasts
to the peaks of the Carnic and Julian Alps, nortwards and, eastwards, from the easternmost part of the Po Valley, through the
Karst plateau and river valleys, to the Danubian basin. Even though about half of the surface of region is occupied by mountains,
archaeological evidence in this area is scanty, at least an early part of the protohistory. The systematic research carried out in
the last 20 years and several sporadic discoveries, allow us to draw a more articulated picture for the mountain district of Friuli
starting only from the Final Bronze Age, a period characterized by the occupation of dominant sites providing a strategic control
on riverways. This is particularly clear in the Early Iron Age, when some sites, which will have a long-lasting cycle of occupation
well, become important nodes of a network connecting the main centres of Veneto and Friuli with the upper Soča and Gail valleys,
which constitute gateways towards regions rich in strategic resources such as metals and salt.
Starting from the advanced 6th century B.C., the mountains of Friuli seem to have reached its maximum development phase for
the pre-Roman period, being part of a system of circulation of artefacts that involves the entire central-eastern Alpine area from
Veneto to Trentino and Slovenia. In particular, the data from the Early Iron Age funerary contexts –strengthened by some analytical results regarding metallurgy and paleodiet, allow us to put forward some observations on the formation of local identities
through the comparison with different mountain and lowland environment.
