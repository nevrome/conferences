perception analysis with the expert knowledge of archaeological landscapes, being the first time that this methodology has
been used in the Canary Islands archaeology. These results will serve to turn public perception into objective data that we can
contrast with official information and initiate social participatory processes in Buenavista Del Norte.
The resulting model aims to explore the public and social value of archaeological heritage in a broader sense than the traditional
and official way which is more individual and isolated, creating and empowering the public value of archaeological landscape in
the public policy strategy. The model also aims to integrate cultural heritage as a fundamental piece in the social, economic and
political development of this municipality, and ultimately to improve the quality of life of the population.
