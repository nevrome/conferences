DIGGING FOR DEMOCRACY: HOW OUR HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT IS HIGHLIGHTING A CRISIS IN THE
DEMOCRATIC CONSULTATION PROCESSES

Presentation Format: Oral
In October 2019 I organised a conference in London titled Engaging with Politics in the UK: Responding to Changes in Planning,
Heritage and the Arts’, which brought practitioners from a range of sectors and industries together to explore how they are practically responding to the vast changes unfolding within heritage, museums, planning and arts sectors. As a Research Associate
in academia, and a Secretary of the civil society pressure group Rescue, I am increasingly concerned with how and whether the
average Joe and Jane Doe are represented in the institutions of law and State, and whether this representation is embedded or
not into the very forms of the urban fabric and daily experience we live in.
The protections of the historic and natural environment are changing at such rapid pace that at best interested or involved stakeholders are aware of changes to policy, or at worst are alienated from being a part of any decision-making and policy implementation processes. In-depth interviews conducted in 2013/14 towards my now completed PhD confirmed that archaeologists are
increasingly feeling pressured and under-valued in their working environment, and that these sentiments are actually justified by
the socio-political pressures in which their work is embedded.
In this presentation, I introduce how the historic environment’s struggle within the changing policies of the planning process in
the UK specifically highlight a crisis of democracy and governance. It explores how practices well understood by archaeologists
can actually help alleviate some of the issues faced by those tackling problems of governance and democratic processes, and
suggests ways forward in these challenging times.
