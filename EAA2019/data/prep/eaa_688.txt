Presentation Format: Oral
In 2017 I interviewed seventeen stakeholders through qualitative interviews using the value typology of Randal Mason, as stated in the Heritage Reader. The selected stakeholders were either representatives of stakeholder organizations or local authorities. The interest of the stakeholders and local authorities for archaeological heritage was measured with both the value typology and the use of a specific participation ladder. In total fifteen carefully selected interview questions were used to initiate a
debate who should take responsibility for the care of archaeological monuments and more important why.
At the session ‘Archaeology, Heritage and Public Value’ I would like to start a debate on how we can use various values typologies.
What are the benefits and pitfalls of using a social and economic value typology through interviewing stakeholders and local
authorities? How do they interpret a participation ladder in the archaeological heritage management system, and what are their
local examples of valuing, caring, and managing archaeological monuments?
