For the last two decades, the management framework for heritage shifted from one centred on the conservation of sites and
monuments (a preservationist approach) to the management of the values underpinning heritage significance (Sullivan 1997;

to the publication of the Burra Charter in 1979, heritage management processes around the world now typically involve the identification of these five types of heritage value at each site and planning around how to sustain and enhance each of these sets
of values (e.g. Deacon 2006; Smith 2006a; Seif 2009; Gómez Robles 2010). Whilst values-based heritage management is now
nearly universal, aspects of its implementation have been challenged (e.g. Poulios 2010; Araoz 2011). We seek to take this challenge further by focusing on the “Preservation/Heritage Values/Management” triptych with the aim of proposing a new methodology for addressing the values attributed to cultural heritage sites. Combining multidisciplinary and cosmopolitan methods, we
propose to move beyond the analysis of the processes of hybridization between attributed heritage values (Duval et al. 2018)
and therefore seek to propose a new manner of addressing issues linked to heritage values-based approach. Our proposal is
based on our researches done in the Maloti-Drakensberg mountains (South African section), where rock art shelters cross a
