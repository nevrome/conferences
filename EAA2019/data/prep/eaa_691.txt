THE SEVEN VIRTUES OF HERITAGE - EVALUATING THE PUBLIC VALUE OF ARCHAEOLOGY
Author(s): van den Dries, Monique (Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University)
Presentation Format: Oral
Recent survey results (NEARCH-project 2015; Kajda et al. 2018) reveal that in various European countries most members of the
public consider archaeology foremost a science, not so much a cultural or leisure activity that plays an important, active role in
their personal life. Moreover, in many countries there is still limited active citizenship involved in the daily archaeological practice,
in interpretation and in governance and preservation. Politicians and policy makers, on the other hand, expect and encourage citizen involvement and empowerment. They stress that cultural heritage and archaeology has or needs to become a driver of social
(and economic) development, as it contributes to the wellbeing and quality of life of citizens. Does this indicate there is a tension
or maybe even a fundamental rift between theory and practice, between expectations and possibilities? What do measurements
indicate that were so far conducted to understand how heritage is valued and how it affects people’s life? This presentation
aims to critically evaluate what is or could be the role of archaeology to contribute to objectives like improving quality of life.
The author wants to add an evidence-based perspective to the question whether heritage-based social innovation can be put in
practice through archaeology and what the sector’s limitations seem to be.
