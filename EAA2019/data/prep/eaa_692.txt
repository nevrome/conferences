This article presents the results of the study carried out during the summer and autumn of 2017 in the Basque Country, with the
purpose of knowing the perception of the non-academic visiting public and the local community in relation to the archaeological
sites put in value. The study was carried out in fifteen archaeological sites located in the three Basque Provinces (Álava, Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia). The chronological range of the study ranges from the Age of Metals to medieval times, in excavations made and
recently curated, as well as works that have been the continuation of an admirable work begun in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. The evaluation methodology used has been double. On the one hand, the realization of quantitative techniques using
the survey, and qualitative techniques with the use of the semi-structured interview. Both methodologies have given us a knowledge of the audiences of archaeological sites in the Basque Country, as well as a map of their management.
