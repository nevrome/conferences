‘WHAT MAKES AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL OBJECT VALUABLE?’ AN EXPLORATION OF ATTITUDES AND
PRACTICES AMONG ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND METAL DETECTORISTS IN NORWAY

Presentation Format: Oral
A now yearly average of ~2000 private metal detecting finds are catalogued at Norway’s five archaeological museums. Metal
detecting finds that are perceived to have little current or future ‘scientific value’ are returned to the finder or destroyed. Destruction often means that an object is relegated to general waste, and put in the bin. These finds have put a financial strain on an
archaeological heritage system that up until recently were unaccustomed with the increasing interest in heritage objects among
the public. A system that was also unequipped to cope with the very tangible results of such an interest. For a while, the finds
and the search for them caused tension and frequent, heated online debates between archaeologists and metal detectorists.
With the aid of stories told during interviews and narratives discovered in the archaeological find databases I will explore how
private metal detecting has affected practices at Norway’s museums, and, as a result – how it is also shaping our future ways of
working and thinking about archaeological heritage objects. Legal definitions aside, what makes an archaeological object valuable and worthy of protection and preservation? During the last two years, as part of my ongoing PhD project, I have asked archaeologists and hobbyist metal detectorists in Norway to answer this question. Although replies do vary, most fall within two related,
and somewhat vague, categories: ‘scientific value’ and ‘potential knowledge’. An objects ability to inform us about how past lives
were lived seem to be an important value criteria for both (certain) heritage practitioners and a specific part of the public.
