manners. Nevertheless, all conservation practices involve accepting a level of modification, which potentially poses a threat
to the maintenance of authenticity. How to maintain the wholeness, truthfulness and realness of heritage sites in conservation practices remains a universal quandary. The Nara Document is undoubtedly a landmark in the establishment of overarching
policy frameworks and conservation philosophies at an international level that correctively go beyond the Eurocentric focus on
materiality. However, discussions regarding a relativisation of the notion of authenticity have also contributed to the creation
of oppositions between Eastern and Western, indigenous and non-indigenous perspectives, making us blind to the ‘common
complexities’ of authenticity despite cultural boundaries.
This paper aims to analyse the complexities of authenticity in both Western and Eastern contexts, following the recently developed argument that authenticity is produced and negotiated through networks of relationships between people, places and
objects. Drawing on ethnographic research focusing on heritage sites in Scotland and China, we reflect on the bifurcation of
heritage practices in relation to authenticity in different cultural scenarios and highlight common threads. We suggest that,
when practicing heritage conservation, the consideration of authenticity should be more concerned with the extent to which
people who consume the heritage are able to incorporate themselves into the networks of relationships invoked by the heritage.
The material fabric and the forms of intervention applied to the heritage are just elements that affect people’s experience of its
authenticity.
