National Trails and right-of-way paths in the United Kingdom form part of a highly-valued network of paths across the country
which provide access to both natural and cultural heritage to the public at no cost. This study assessed visitors’ and users’ perceptions of right-of-way paths within the Avebury World Heritage Site and along the Ridgeway National Trail. The study utilised
questionnaires and interviews to determine users’ perception of the environmental degradation to the paths, and what values
the visitors and users ascribed to the paths. The study determined that regular users of the paths were generally not aware that
they caused an environmental impact by using the paths and that they valued the paths more for the free access to the countryside that they provide than for the biodiversity or archaeology that can be found along the paths. Visitors to the Avebury World
Heritage Site were generally not aware that they could use the right-of-way paths to move through the landscape and as a result
they drove to specific sites and then left. The implications of this study are that the management of the Avebury World Heritage Site and the Ridgeway National Trail should provide adequate signposting and information boards along the paths to raise
awareness of the heritage and biodiversity found along the paths and highlight the impact caused to the paths, the surrounding
environment and the archaeology nearby. There is an urgent need to address the way the public views National Heritage spaces
since they often do not view them as heritage spaces unless that is made explicit.
