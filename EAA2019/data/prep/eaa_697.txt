TOWARDS A CRITICAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM
Author(s): Stobiecka, Monika (Faculty of “Artes Liberales”, University of Warsaw)
Presentation Format: Oral
In my talk, I will reflect on the future of archaeological museum as an institution that is actively engaged in public debates on
current social, cultural and economic problems (climate change, migration crisis, nationalism), and serves as an instrument of
democratic education. I would discuss an idea of a “critical archaeological museum” inspired by the project of a “critical museum”
developed by the Polish art historian and critic - Piotr Piotrowski. I am particularly interested in Piotrowski’s claim that a boundary condition for a critical museum is its close relation to the valid paradigms and theories discussed in academic circles. For
Piotrowski, only by (re)connecting museums and academies, museums can actively engage in on-going social discussions and
debates.
My speech will be illustrated with contemporary Polish artwork by Agnieszka Kalinowska, “Heavy water,” an urban installation
consisted of African vessels’ copies that, according to artist’s intention, illustrate the migration crisis. I will show that a contemporary artwork inspired by archaeological objects and researches is more effective in bringing up important planetary problems
than archaeological museums, that ignore present and instead focus on petrified past. I will suggest that addressing shared
social dilemmas and problems by linking past and present is the best way to rework the public image of archaeological museums
and grasp them as future-oriented institutions. I will provide a speculative model of a “critical archaeological museum” that presents archaeology’s “Grand Challenges” through contemporary artworks.
