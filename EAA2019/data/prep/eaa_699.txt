term connections with local communities, educational outreach in all fields can increase the value of a historic site, and many
aspects of history can inform lessons on science and technology. This paper follows the case of Cooper Gristmill, a historic mill
site in New Jersey, and its participation in a state-wide STEM event. What the historic site can offer for STEM education, and
what it gets in return, are evaluated; as are the process of collaboration with the event organizers before and after the event, the
sustainability of any partnerships created, and the impact of the event on site visitation.
