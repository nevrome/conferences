OBJECT EPISTEMOLOGIES AND THE PRACTICES OF EDITING THINGS: AN INTRODUCTION
Author(s): Hofmann, Kerstin - Wigg-Wolf, David (RGK - Romano-Germanic Commission DAI)
Presentation Format: Oral
Object epistemologies (after Markus Hilgert) address the question of how multiple and variable object identities arise when
dealing with things, and how they in turn affect epistemic practices. This is not just an academic question, but also has social,
economic, political and ethical dimensions. Corpora are a central epistemic instrument of knowledge generation for the archaeology of the Western World. But for a long time they were regarded as old-fashioned and part of an antiquarian tradition. This
has, however, changed now that everyone is talking about digitisation and research data management; attention has turned
once more to various strategies and the politics of representation, and in the course of the debate on (post-)factualism and
cultures of knowledge and data we are striving to render the production of knowledge more visible and comprehensible. Following Bruno Latour, editions can be interpreted as translations and products of a praxeological connection between the world
and representations. But who (should) own(s) the objects and their representations, who sets the agenda, and who is allowed
to join the new democratic (?) projects for editing archaeological findings (citizen science versus knowledge by authority). How
do we deal with colonial objects and negative heritage? How can we better do justice to things, beyond the usual classifications
and description logics; must things in editions always become frozen as objects? These and other questions will be raised in our
introduction.
