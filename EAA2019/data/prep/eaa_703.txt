MAKING ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA FAIR
Author(s): Richards, Julian (Archaeology Data Service, University of York)
Presentation Format: Oral
My contribution will discuss recent developments in European e-infrastructures for research, including ARIADNEplus, E-RIHS
(European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science) and SSHOC (Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud). These initiatives are helping foster an Open Access approach to data, and a FAIR approach to data management, but it is important that archaeologists engaged with these organisations, so that the importance of our research is reflected in wider European agendas.
The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) is playing a part in each, and I will briefly introduce our contribution and seek feedback on
the best ways for archaeologists to engage with them. For ARIADNEplus I will introduce the task forces charged with surveying,
collecting, creating and managing multilingual domain thesauri and vocabularies which are essential for data integration within
the ARIADNE e-infrastructure. These cover fields as diverse as human palaeo-biology and paleo-environments, analytical investigations, archaeological prospection, standing structures, fieldwork, metal-detector surveys, and archaeological finds and
inscriptions.
