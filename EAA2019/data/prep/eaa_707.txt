JOINT NATIONAL OWNERSHIP THROUGH WIDELY VARIED CONNECTIONS. THE FUTURE OF PORTABLE
ANTIQUITIES OF THE NETHERLANDS (PAN)

Presentation Format: Oral
The project Portable Antiquities of the Netherlands (PAN) studies archaeological finds discovered by private individuals, often
using a metal detector, and publishes these online, with the help of both volunteers and professionals. The system uses uniform
descriptions (‘reference types’) in order to process the high volume of finds in a structured way. PAN is therefore both a digital
thesaurus for archaeological material culture and a digital publication of collections of antiquities. The database can be searched
by the wider public, bulk datasets can be extracted by academics, and connections with DANS (the national trusted repository)
ensures the long-term storage and delivery to search engines such as Ariadne.
Although the long-term availability of the digital infrastructure is safeguarded by the National Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, keeping the staff for the data collection is a challenge. Help comes from partners in the regions: even before the setup-phase of the PAN-projects will end, various parties expressed interest to continue the data collection. It involves many volunteers in various bodies (museums, associations). The local demand for co-creation (real citizen science) provides the clue to
solve this particular challenge.
The future looks bright for PAN because of the joint national ownership. This ownership is felt by all parties involved because the
system caters for needs of various interest groups at varying levels.
