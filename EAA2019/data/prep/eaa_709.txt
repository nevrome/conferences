MINOR OBJECTS - BIG DATA. HOW TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE EVERYDAY OBJECTS
Author(s): Langner, Martin - Janda, Manuel (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen)
Presentation Format: Poster
In relation to Material Culture Studies event based structures are already implemented to Collection Management Systems.
These give the possibility to describe the whole lifespan of an object. The problem is that we are usually not able to reconstruct
the complete ‘biography’ of an artefact, and in relation to function the shape (e.g. of a ring or a jug) is more often irrelevant than
archaeologists use to believe: form does not necessarily follow function!
The results of a BA thesis concerning a multimodal approach to archaeological databases will be presented answering questions
like: Which criteria of categorisation are needed for things of every day life? How does the fluidity of use can be modelled? What
can be learnt from actual discussions in Design and Marketing Studies? What kind of help comes from Big Data approaches like
Image Content Exploration or Cultural Analytics? Which statistical approach is most appropriate for household studies in terms
of every day life?
