The rock-cut tombs are underground architectures which were especially used in Mediterranean later prehistory. Present since
the middle of the 5th millennium BC, they are more particularly developed during the second half of the 4th millennium and the
first half of the 3rd millennium. The question of the origin and appearance of hypogea has long been the subject of an important
debate proposing the development of this type of funerary architecture in connection with contacts from the Eastern Mediterranean, before focusing on the autochthonous origin of the hypogea in certain regions such as Sardinia. This problem is accompanied by important works on the chronology of hypogea. Difficult to address because of the absence of closed sets and their
intensive reuse, the dating of hypogea was completely revised with the multiplication of radiocarbon datings from the 1970s
(Whitehouse, 1972). This issue is still the subject of numerous articles thanks to the discovery of new burials and the renewal
of data on the subject (Malone et al., 1995, Gonçalvès, Andrade and Pereira, 2004, Valera, 2012, Negroni Catacchio et al., 2014,
Tiberi and Dell’Anna, 2014). The purpose of this communication is to offer a new perspective on this debate using the study of
know-how involved in the establishment and the digging of hypogea. The digging of prehistoric rock-cut tombs, subject of a
thesis defended in 2018, requires a set of common knowledge to human groups practicing the exploitation of soils, both in the
context of the implementation of funerary architectures and in the extraction of mineral resources. This study, through the prism
