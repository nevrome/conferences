EAA2500 - THINKING THE FUTURE IN ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT
Theme: Archaeological theory and methods beyond paradigms
Organisers: Holtorf, Cornelius - HÃ¶gberg, Anders (Linnaeus University) - Fredheim, Harald (University of York)
Format: Regular session
It is often claimed that archaeological heritage is to be preserved for the benefit of future generations. Recently, researchers and practioners have begun to ask what this means. How do different perceptions of the future inform how archaeology is
practiced and heritage is managed? Which future do archaeologists and heritage professionals actually work for? What kind of
archaeology and heritage will be needed in the future (and how do we know)? How do archaeologists best support cultural resilience or contribute in other ways to sustainable societies? Most importantly, how can we build capacity in future thinking among
archaeologists and heritage professionals? This session invites papers that address the need to think and plan for a range of
futures in archaeology and archaeological heritage management, so that our work can create the benefits we aim for.
