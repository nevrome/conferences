ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND THE FUTURE â€“ AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE TO LAST?
Author(s): Holtorf, Cornelius (Linnaeus University)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper reviews how archaeologists think and reason in relation to the future. The paper starts with a short discussion of
existing research on the Archaeology of the Future, from studying implied futures in prehistoric monuments, to applying archaeological knowledge to improving agriculture in unfavourable conditions, to predictions of environmental change. In the second
part of the paper, I will turn to future literacy as it is evident (or not) in archaeological heritage management which often aims
at preserving material evidence of the past for the benefit of future generations. But how does the practice of archaeological
heritage management actually relate to the future? I will discuss in particular some experiences gained during future workshops
we have been running over the last few years with archaeologists and heritage managers in Sweden and abroad (see also http://
lnu.se/en/unescochair). Archaeology and the future may not be love at first sight but is the future here to stay?
