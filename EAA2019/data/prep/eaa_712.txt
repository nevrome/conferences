This paper approaches the major research question of how to re-tie the material and immaterial knots between past, present and
future generations. It discusses the politicization of the long-term within the natural/cultural heritage sectors and the layers of
vernacular temporalities that meet and transform on a particular site of present contestation, namely a garbage disposal site
and hightech energy-to-waste plant that is situated on an Iron Age archaeological sanctuary in urban mid-Sweden. Starting from
this site we attempt a discussion on intergenerational justice and convivial deep time care as it draws on approaches and analytics from critical posthumanism, multispecies humanities/posthumanities and the feminist environmental humanities. What are
the possibilities and challenges for deep time interventions and intragenerational ethics? How do the relationships with past and
present generations addressed in sustainability efforts gets envisaged? What does multispecies posthumanism bring about
that alter discussions on time, presentism, representationalism and critical heritage discourse? From such vantage points we
find it important to check in with deep time practices and imaginaries as humanityâ€™s short-sighted actions, extractions and consumptions, so far, have become a planetary force with accelerating effects on the biosphere rein in the future for multispecies
generations to come.
