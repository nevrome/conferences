IMAGINING THE PRACTICE, APPRECIATION AND VALUE OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE FUTURE: THREE
APPROACHES
Author(s): Fleming, Arlene (The World Bank)
Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation addresses the question proposed in the session abstract: “How can we build capacity in future thinking among
archaeologists and heritage professionals?” Lacking the proverbial crystal ball, three approaches are suggested and elaborated
to stimulate thought and action by archaeologists regarding the practice, appreciation and value of archaeology and archaeological heritage management in the future. First, we may consider the astonishing advances in archaeological exploration, documentation and analysis during recent decades, and on this basis, predict further advancement. How do we envision further
developments and what will be the implications? A second approach should take into account the vast increase in, attention to,
and fascination with archaeology, as apparent in academia, financial institutions, private industry the media and the general public. How can the support of these actors be enlisted in the future? They will be needed. Thirdly, it is essential to consider current
and projected conditions of life on earth: our increasing consciousness of a changing climate and its repercussions, including
migration, conflict, political and economic instability. What are the implications for archaeology? What actions will be necessary
for enhancing and curating the archaeological record under these circumstances, and for protecting exposed archaeological
material including records - written and virtual - as well as objects and sites? How can knowledge of the past inform the present
and future, given the fact that we have archaeological evidence of similar conditions?
