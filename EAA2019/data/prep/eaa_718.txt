TOO MUCH ARCHAEOLOGY?

Where will we keep all the things we are preserving for future generations?
The Profusion theme of the Heritage Futures project has explored how people make decisions about which everyday objects to
keep for the future - in light of all the things that could be collected. Our findings show that despite efforts to collect less and
dispose of more objects, most social history museums are adding at least ten new objects for every one they let go.
This paper connects our research into collections development decisions in social history collections with results from the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists’ 2017 report on ”21st-century Challenges for Archaeology” and the Society for Museum Archaeology’s 2018 ”Guidance on the Rationalisation of Museum Archaeology Collections” to ask searching questions about the
futures of archaeological collections. If we cannot care for all the objects we feel we should keep for the future, should we be
revisiting archaeological ethics to reconsider how we can use archaeological objects in the present?
