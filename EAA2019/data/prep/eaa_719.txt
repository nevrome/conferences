This presentation seeks to illuminate issues in existent and emerging archaeological collections, particularly the method in
which they are being (re)valorised for future generations.
Processing practices of archaeological material fall into the overlap of two major disciplines - archaeology and heritage studies, intertwined with a dash of preservation strategies. More than any other discipline dealing with the past, archaeology has
a privileged position to produce the subject of its inquiry. It transforms artefacts’ values immediately starting from discovery,
then through selection practices during excavation and, finally, their interpretation. This mechanism of knowledge production is
typically followed by the institutionalization of codified knowledge and transitioning of selected objects into museums. Also, archaeology, heritage studies, and conservation repetitively produce infinite data and documentation legacies, which bears great
significance on current and future valorisation of findings. The essence of the conundrum of archaeological heritage lies at the
intersection of collecting the past to use in the future.
In the Western Balkans, collecting strategies have remained conservative in nature; hence, their collections do not necessarily
