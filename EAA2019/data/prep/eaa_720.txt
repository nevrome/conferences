reflect the complexity of the past. The countries of the region are yet impoverished, post-conflict, post-socialist and liberal
stabilitocracies, wielding a strong influence on the professional framework of their archaeologies. It is then relevant to posit to
what extent these contexts influence, not only current archaeological management and collection strategies, but future ones
as well, especially in light of EU standards.
Thus, in order to understand the future of archaeological collecting, we need to dissect the present understanding of traces
from the past. To achieve such, the process of collecting and assigning value must receive scrutiny so that future management
of archaeological collections in the Western Balkans can be (re)built in line with professional standards that allow for a complex
picture of the past.
