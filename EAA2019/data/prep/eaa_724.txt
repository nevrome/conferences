archaeology projects provide breeding ground for specific participative dynamics, having a influence on the future of the stakeholders and the surrounding territory.
This paper argues that both insider and outsider stakeholders are usually unaware of the values they mutually attach to the site
and, consequently, the future scenarios they propose tend to be self-referential. As a result, their proposals often lack feasibility
and sustainability. For example, a joint site management between the archaeologists and the resident community depends on
the effective involvement of both sides. Heritage professionals may have a pivotal role in highlighting the emerging trends from
the participative dynamics’ analysis, suggesting various context-based actions that can benefit both the site and its present
and future stakeholders.
This paper presents the different participative dynamics and envisioned futures for three case studies investigated within my
PhD research. The overall analysis suggests that models like participatory governance – recently ranked among the priorities of
the European Union - may work for the future developments of community archaeology projects.
