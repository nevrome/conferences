Based on a cycle-based model we investigate how climate proxies of local to regional scope may have shaped the dynamics
of simple farming societies in Central Europe. These regional socio-economic dynamics are then compared with proxies of supra-regional explanatory power and their possible effects on large historical processes such as the spread of agriculture. We
discuss cross-scale relationships and possible feedback effects between regional and supra-regional cultural processes.
Our study focuses on the Early Neolithic Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), the succeeding Middle Neolithic, and the Young Neolithic
Michelsberg Culture in the immediate study area, namely western Central Europe.
While these archaeological cultures differ in their settlement system as well as their economic basis, they nevertheless appear
to have undergone similar cycles of social resilience. While climate may have had positive effects on population growth, negative effects on decline as a “triggering force” cannot be observed within the chronological model applied. We therefore propose
internal social processes as the main forces for the observed curve progressions.
This hypothesis appears to be applicable across scales.
