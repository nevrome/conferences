During the Last Glacial Period (ca. 12,700 to 9,600 BC) the Northern Hemisphere experienced a series of dramatic and relatively
fast environmental and climatic changes. These fluctuations, recorded in the Greenland ice-cores and other fossil archives led
to a substantial transformation of natural conditions.
The development of research into accurate documentation of climate changes over the past several thousand years allows us
to trace them with even 20 years accuracy, which is less than the average life expectancy of any member of a hunter-gatherer
community. However, the crucial issue is the synchronization of local climatic fluctuations with the global ones. The equally important question, asked by many researchers, is if these changes affected past human behavior and to what extent.
We would like to present the results of studies focused on Federmesser hunter-gatherers, developing in the Late Glacial on the
North European Plain, respond to climate and environmental change over time. To achieve this goal we applied several methods
to recognize potential differences in plant succession in various regions of the North European Plain, determine the absolute
chronology of climatic changes and identify the chronology of the development of Federmesser in diverse ecological niches.
