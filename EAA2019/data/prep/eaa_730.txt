The Neolithisation process is characterised by a shift to permanent food-producing economies. This resulted in vulnerabilities
to climate-induced food shortages due to crop failures and livestock deaths, potentially leading to human malnutrition-driven
migrations. Reconstructing climate change in prehistory is thus crucial to elucidating the resilience of past populations to extreme climatic events. Such impacts on human populations can be highly regionalised making their detection challenging due to
a scarcity of well-dated local or on-site terrestrial palaeoclimate records.
Here we show that climate-driven changes in the hydrogen isotope composition of ancient animal fats preserved in pottery vessels are detectable at archaeological sites. A recent study at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük (Turkey) showed that the animal
fat δD values covary with the well-known abrupt climate event at 8.2 kyr BP. Furthermore, multiple strands of archaeo(zoo)logical
evidence point at major changes in human behaviour at this time. We argue that animal fats from archaeological pottery vessels
offer potential as a palaeoprecipitation proxy.
