Because of the site’s long uninterrupted sequence from ca. 7100 to 5500 BC, Çatalhöyük and its environment are a good case
study to scrutinize the multifaceted evidence and short- and long-term impact of and adaptations to the 8.2. event. This paper
will discuss the most recent debates in the context of the site of Çatalhöyük in general, and the latest results of the research
on its West Mound in particular. It shows that the beginnings of Çatalhöyük West at ca. 6100 BC overlapped seamlessly with
the end of the older East Mound, and that the adaptations to environmental changes associated with the 8.2 event are characterized by resilience including a gradual spatial transformation of the settlement within the confines of the East Mound around
8.2, followed by a relocation to the West Mound and a final abandonment of the settlement 5500 BC – including the other settlements on the Konya Plain. With its distinctive pattern of traits resembling the classic levels of the East Mound, traits first
attested on the later levels of the East Mound and newly developed features, the data from Çatalhöyük West represent both
resilience and collapse surrounding the 8.2 event in Central Anatolia.
