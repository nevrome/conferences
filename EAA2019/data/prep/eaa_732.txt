Use of proxy data from specimens such as speleothems, pollen, ice cores, testate amoeba, molluscs to name just a few are well
established as a useful methodology in establishing Palaeo environment and climates of a region during the Holocene in Europe.
A good source of some of these specimens are cores from Ombrotrophic Peat Bogs.
This paper will demonstrate firstly the seasonality of most palaeoclimate reconstructions and further illustrate that choice of
the source of the proxy data can determine the usefulness of that proxy data.
I will demonstrate that using the unique physical, biological and chemical qualities of Ombrotrophic Peat Bogs as a source of
informative stable isotopic data has been underutilised and appears to be using only the Oxygen component and ignores other
qualities of Sphagnum Moss as Proxy Data.
This paper will demonstrate how that in addition to the Oxygen it is the Carbon and Hydrogen stable isotopic elements that hold
key information as to the melting of and receding Ice sheets and Glaciers during the early to mid Holocene and possibly also the
reestablishment of the North Atlantic Drift current that affects our climate to this day.
Additionally, a simple aspect of the ombrotrophic nature of these bogs gives a unique insight into the changing climates of a
region over a period of time in that they Donâ€™t Migrate come winter. I will be illustrating this by a palaeoclimatic case study from
the Neolithic onwards based on an ombrotrophic peat bog in midland Ireland.
