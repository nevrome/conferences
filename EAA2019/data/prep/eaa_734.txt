Human-driven decisions in combination with the climate conditions during Early Neolithic must have been one of the crucial
factors behind the choice of inhabiting the lacustrine settlement of La Draga (7270-6750 cal BP) (Banyoles, NE Iberia). While,
nowadays the prehistoric settlement is found partially under waterlogged conditions, that hasn’t always been the case. New
soil micromorphological data retrieved from the excavated sectors at La Draga, have shown that the occupation of the settlement happened over a newly exposed shore of lake marsh at close proximity to the lake. The exposure of lake marsh would have
occurred by drastic decline of lake water level in the context of a cooling phase, as detected for the period 7400-6900 cal BP in
Western Mediterranean (Frigola et al., 2007). Other geomorphological changes after or during the Neolithic occupation include
the ground subsidence and the formation of sinkholes, and the effects those had on the sedimentary record, explaining why
part of the Neolithic settlement have been under waterlogged conditions since Neolithic times. Their subsequent correlation
with the pollen results retrieved also from the same sectors help, on a next stage, to decipher the impact in vegetation of the
abovementioned climatic and sedimentological events. Palaeoenvironmental evolution would have been affected by anthropogenic (i.e. associated deforestation processes and input of terrigenous sediments from the inland) as well as by climate factors
(water-level fluctuations and subsidence events) during Early Neolithic at the site of La Draga.
