Microenvironments offer crucial refugia that enable ecological adaptations during both abrupt climatic events as well as long
term state changes. Microclimates in mountainous regions are particularly important in this process, where they can form cryptic refugia. Locating and understanding ecological dynamics in these settings can be difficult. This paper presents two cases
where archaeological data, geospatial modeling, and paleoclimatic data help identify refugial environments and characterize
hydroclimatic responses to past paleoenvironments. The examples come from the mountainous Andean region of Peru. Past and
current precipitation in this region is highly variable, and localized conditions are crucial for understanding paleo-hydroclimates.
Paleoclimate and remote sensing data help to contextualize ecological function within hydroclimate reconstructions, while archaeological data help to identify specific areas that could sustain ecological communities. Combined, this approach helps not
only to understand past human â€“ climatic interactions, but further enables us to identify cryptic microenvironments that can be
crucial for addressing future climate change impacts.
