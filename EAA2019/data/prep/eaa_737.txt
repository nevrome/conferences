The paper deals with the perception of frontiers and borders between nomad and settled people in the Near East from the ancient to modern times. Examining a series of cases ranging from the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, the level of integration/
segregation between nomadic and urban societies will be discussed, taking into account the material evidence (archaeological
and textual) of physical and/or immaterial barriers. The development of a dimorphic society in the ancient Near East has been
advocated to explain the strong interaction between semi-nomadic people and agricultural centers along the valley of the Euphrates as a persistent and structural element of the organization of the political entities during the Bronze Age. However the
presence of a long stone wall running tens of kilometers along the so-called arid margins in the steppic region of central and
northern inner Syria testifies for the presence of some kind of border at that time, while inscriptions from Mesopotamia stated
the erection of a defensive wall to protect the territory from the ‘nomadic’ Martu people. At the time of the great empires (Assyrian, Babylonian, Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian) various modalities of interactions with the tribal groups can be identified
in the political control through the provincial system and related with geographical boundaries. The nomadism of the Arabian
tribes emerged also during the 1st millennium BC, gaining a strong importance through the control of the caravan routes linking
the Arabia Felix with the Levant. How is the existence of modern political frontiers interrelated with these structures of ancient
societies? and how is the surviving spatial distribution of archaeological remains reflecting such models of interactions?
