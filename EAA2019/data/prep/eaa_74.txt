25 years ago ex-Yugoslavia was still in amid the war that ended with its dissolution. It goes without saying that archaeological
research witnessed a break that lasted until the conflict was over and beyond –with relevant differences in each of the new-born
countries. B. Govedarica’s seminal work on the Early Bronze Age Cetina culture dates to 1989. By adopting a culture-historical
approach he focussed mainly on its inland dimension. On the other hand, starting from the 1990s the overseas spread of Cetina features in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC caught the attention of scholars (Maran 1998; Cazzella 1999) whose
research was however centred on regions outside its core area that is Dalmatia. From then onwards, alongside the flourishing of
Mediterranean Archaeology as field of research (Broodbank 2013), the overseas dimension of Cetina has attracted increasing
attention. It has indeed become clear that this wide circulation of models and objects resulted from a phenomenon of multiple
long-range interactions.
In 2018 new research on Palagruža (Forenbaher 2018) shed light on different aspects of transadriatic connections. Yet, the
inland dimension of Cetina remains somehow neglected. Can we understand the “international” Mediterranean dimension of the
Cetina phenomenon without having a clear picture of the Cetina culture in its core?
