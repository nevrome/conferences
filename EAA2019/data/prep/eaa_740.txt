A complex array of political and socio-cultural logics contributes to the representation and protection of shared heritage, often
through various expressions of conflicting interests, emotions and interactions among a wide range of stakeholders. this paper
will focus on the case of Hasankeyf, a still-inhabited ancient frontier city in southeast Turkey that is due to be fully submerged
by floodwaters of a dam project and thus planned to be relocated to a remote settlement with its local inhabitants and several
cultural properties. It will thus explore the actors involved in the protection of this living frontier heritage in case of urban change,
analyse their expressions of conflicting priorities and reactions to the case, their involvement in the decision making and will
assess their impacts on reclaiming their right to shared heritage. Hasankeyf is a cultural landscape of universal significance that
sparks ongoing debates about the management of change in cultural landscapes, methods of preservation, ongoing salvage
campaigns, as well as the diversity of contested urban histories and discourses. Going beyond the concern for architectural conservation limited to the protection of the built heritage, this paper will further examine the various narratives and oral histories
of the actors concerned about the safeguarding of this historic landscape. In this way, a new methodology incorporating social
network analysis and decision modelling into ethnographic methodology will also be introduced to assess the interpretation,
presentation and protection of the shared built heritage inherited from culturally and ethnically distinct communities. In sum,
this paper will contribute to the field of cultural heritage through the introduction of a novel case, an innovative methodological
approach and a distinct perspective that examines the interactions among a wide range of actors, their reactions to change and
impact on the right to shared heritage at frontiers.
