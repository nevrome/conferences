HADRIAN’S WALL AS A ‘POST-NATIONAL BORDER’
Author(s): Hingley, Richard (Dept. of Archaeology, University of Durham)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper explores the recent afterlife of the Roman Frontier work, Hadrian’s Wall, addressing the concept of ‘post-national border’. Cooper and Rumford (2013) have developed this concept. Exploring practices, including art works and festivals, that have
occurred on former borders that once served to separate peoples and states, they address the transformative and inclusive
character of such installations and events.
This paper interprets Hadrian’s Wall as a place of encounter and commemoration. Addressing several festivals that have been
held along the line of the monument from 2000 to 2017, it explores the roles of re-enactment and living history in bringing the
monument to public attention. Also considered are events and installations that may help to challenge popular understandings
off current bordering and mobilities (Hingley 2018).
