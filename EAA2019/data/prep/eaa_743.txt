In the so called medieval islamic world frontiers were a flexible, almost non-existing concept. Following from east to west, the
steps of Ibn Battuta, and from west to east those of Marco Polo, literary sources may enlighten contemporary researchers on
the transparent borders that used to shape countries and empires. The aim of this paper is to focus on the strong continuity that
we can see characterizes the architecture and the material culture of sites among the different states that are actually part of
the Rojava, the recently formed Kurdish state. Since Kurdish people have lived among the Ilkhanid, then Timurid, then Safavid and
Ottoman era as an active and vital part of the cited islamic empires, on a geographical area that covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey,
Armenia and Iran, this research aims to explore the cultural modernity of the frontiers’ issue of Kurdistan (of which the Rojava
state, even if recognized, would be only a part). Frontiers and state didn’t exist as long as the islamic broad empire system lasted,
therefore Kurdish people are one of the best example of cultural identity in an outstanding continuity of tastes, trades, fashions,
items, that managed to survive without geographical boundaries until the twentieth century. The creation of a Kurdish state
rises therefore many questions, also for the cultural and archaeological sites.
