FRONTIER SYMBOLISM IN EUROPEAN AND US RIGHT-WING POPULISM
Author(s): Bonacchi, Chiara (University of Stirling)
Presentation Format: Oral
This paper will discuss how frontiers, borders and walls of the past (ancient to more recent) are used by right-wing populist parties in Europe and the US today. How have politicians being leveraging these concepts and their material and immaterial features
to forge easy-to-consume narratives informed by nostalgia? Why should we study these political meanings of heritage and how
can this research be helpful to shed further light on contemporary politics and society? Drawing on social media data, analysed
through a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach, I will seek answers to the questions mentioned above. The presentation
is informed by work undertaken on this topic in order to prepare a monograph (forthcoming), written in the context of the project
‘Ancient Identities in Modern Britain’ (2016-2019), funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council. The project is a collaboration between the University of Durham (Archaeology and Anthropology) and the University of Stirling.
