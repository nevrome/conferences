riality” organized in Malta (2008). The first official action of the community “Archaeology and gender in Europe” (AGE) was the organization of a round table “Gender and Archaeology in Europe” in Riva del Garda (2009). Ten years have passed since the forming
of AGE – ten years which, in many aspects, have been quite worrying at a global level. We have, for instance, witnessed the rise
of nationalist and right-wing ideologies in many European countries and beyond. This has resulted in attempts to ban university
programs in gender studies outside archaeology, based on the argument that they represent ideology rather than science. Some
have questioned the validity of awards for female scientists, and invoked political reasons for achieving gender equality through
these awards. At the same time, several groups have demonstrated increased levels of sexual harassment in archaeology. This
roundtable aims to reflect upon these matters in the context of gender archaeology. What is the situation of gender in archaeology today? What changes have these last ten years brought? What is the role of AGE as a community in these matters and what
should be its future trajectory? We invite contributors to explore topics such as the incorporation of gender-related themes in
contemporary archaeological education and investigation, in university programs and agendas of research institutes; sexual
harassment in archaeology; as well as LGBTQ rights and the use of archaeology in homo-nationalist discourses.
