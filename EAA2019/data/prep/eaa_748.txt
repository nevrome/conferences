Presentation Format: Oral
From the field of archeology and education, school workshops have had a remarkable success due to its attractive hands on
activities, based frequently on active methodologies and school learning by discovery. Emphasis on the contribution of archaeology to the learning and procedures has resulted to a lower in deepening the conceptual and historical contents in these workshops. This is especially relevant making reference to the introduction of gender perspective in education of archeology, where
schools work about archaeological methods or experiments and they are designed as neutral activities, but they are not. In this
text, we briefly pretend to review what gender archaeology has contributed from academia and in which way it can be applied to
the formal education institutions, specifically in the proposals of activities of primary and secondary school workshops, but also
to early childhood activities. Taking into account this principle, we will expose some study cases that have been designed by us.
