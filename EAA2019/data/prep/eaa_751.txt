Kenaion and the sanctuary of Artemis Amarynthia near Eretria. Some others need to be added to this list, such as the sanctuary
of Artemis Prosioa near Cap Artemision. Most of these sanctuaries have never been excavated and in several cases we donâ€™t
even know their exact location. Recently, the Swiss Archaeological School in Greece and the Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea
identified the site of the sanctuary of Artemis Amarynthia and the still ongoing excavations will throw a new light on our knowledge of the sacred landscape of the island of Euboea. The aim of this keynote is to give a state of the research concerning the
Euboean sanctuaries and, through the example of the discovery of the Artemision of Amarynthos, to show what we might expect
in future research programs.
