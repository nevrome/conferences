SEA ROUTES

Presentation Format: Oral
In the context of the circumnavigations of the Mediterranean in the 1st millennium BC, attention has been drawn by the historians mainly to the transfer of gods and sacred objects (the Greek aphidrumata), as well as to the constitution of pantheons in
the newly established settlements, and to the creation of Mediterranean mythology, while there was less interest in the ritual
practices themselves and the traces they have left.
What archaeological traces, then, did rites leave in the places of worship in polytheistic ancient societies? This question deserves further research. Following the Euboeans in the Aegean and further away in the Mediterranean is a good study case, in
view of the many cultic assemblages recently excavated on Euboea, in the Aegean, Northern Greece and Italy.
Beyond the architectural remains and material culture, we will therefore investigate the ecofacts and gestures of the ancient
people. The aim of this keynote, as an introduction to the session, is to open the discussion on the identity markers of the Euboeans and the local and foreign populations with whom they were in contact at home and overseas.
