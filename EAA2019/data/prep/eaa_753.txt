This paper aims to present the architectural remains and the finds which are associated with a cult site in Zarakes in the region
of Central-Southern Euboea.
Noteworthy among the finds is a relief fragment belonging to a mid-7th century B.C. pithos; it bears a repeating motif of centaurs
and, most importantly, an inscription which identifies this site as a sanctuary, in use since the Archaic period.
The continuation of worship in Classical times is documented both by the discovery of black-grazed skyphoi with the inscription
IE on their base -the abbreviation of the word sacred- in a 4th century B.C. building, and also by pottery sherds with graffiti and
symbols. Moreover, a bronze weight bearing a ram head as a symbol and the inscription Apollonos Delio is indicative of the existence in Zarakes of a cult site, devoted to the homonymous god.
The various dedicatory finds show that the sanctuary was in use from LG to late classical times during which period it flourished.
In Hellenistic times it seems to be on decline and is gradually abandoned.
