Since 2010 archaeologists of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Ehporate of Antiquities of Euboia are engaged in two
field work projects in southern Euboia. One is a multidisciplinary project focusing on the excavations at Plakari, most probably
the location of Early Iron Age and Archaic Karystos. The other is a combined pedestrian and remote sensing survey, exploring ancient overland roads and routes and infrastructure facilitating maritime communications. The Plakari excavations have brought
to light a hilltop cult site functioning between the early 11th and later 4th c. BC. One of the discoveries made during the surveys
was a road system connecting Plakari to a rural cult site on the opposite Karababa hill. In my paper I will discuss the character of
the cult activities and rituals taking place at Plakari, their spatial, architectural and social setting, and the wider cultic landscape
that included the late Archaic-Classical rural sanctuary of Karababa and other cult sites, such as those on Mt Ochi and at Kastri
(ancient Geraistos).
