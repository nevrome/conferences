jointly conducted by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea and the VR University of Amsterdam.
Other similar inscribed ceramic and metal finds from various sites in Euboea are housed in the National Archaeological Museum
in Athens, as well as in the Archaeological Museum of Karystos. This paper aims to an overview of the evidence and a preliminary
evaluation of the data gathered from inscribed vases and other eloquent small finds from Southern Euboean cultic sites that are
dated from the Archaic to the late Hellenistic period.
In conclusion, an attempt will be made to ascertain the relation of the evidence presented above to the cultic landscape of Karystos, the main ancient polis in the southern part of Euboea, a region nearest to central Aegean trade routes.
