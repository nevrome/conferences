The extra-urban sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia in Amarynthos was according to epigraphic and literary sources the most important cult place of Euboea. It was controlled by the city state of Eretria and attracted crowds from the entire island during the
festivals of the Artemisia. The identification of the sanctuary in 2017 with the site excavated since 2007 by the Swiss School
of Archaeology in Greece and the Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea east of modern Amarynthos is a milestone in the study of
the religious landscape of Euboea and beyond, in a region where several sanctuaries of Artemis are known along the Euboean
Gulf. The remains unearthed so far include a large Doric stoa, a sacred well, a monumental Early Archaic building with antae and
at least nine other edifices.
The research project funded since 2017 by the Swiss National Science Foundation turned its interest in 2018 to the exploration
of the general topography of the sanctuary and the origin of the cult. The current excavation focuses on two main sectors: the
central courtyard bordered by porticoes, where the foundations of a monumental base (altar?) and a miniature bronze quiver of a
statue were recently found, and the 7th c. BC large public hall which is built above earlier buildings and layers from the Early Iron
Age, going back at least to the 10th c. BC. This paper will present the results of the 2018 and 2019 campaigns, the latter – one
month after the excavation season – for the first time.
