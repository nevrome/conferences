THE CONTRIBUTION OF SENSORY ARCHAEOLOGY TO CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN PREHISTORY

Presentation Format: Oral
Sensory archaeology has now become an accepted part of archaeological method and theory, characterised by a well-grounded
set of key concepts and debates and by a healthy diversity of perspectives. Bringing together the culturally diverse sensory
assemblages and impacts of artefacts, human burials, buildings and landscapes, and their associated politics, a growing number
of archaeological case studies has persuasively emphasised the remarkable variety of ways in which we make sense of the world
around us, especially as members of societies and cultures with particular sensory orders and dynamics. Such studies have
also reflected on our own particular ways of seeing and sensing, including the biases and misrepresentations of archaeological
museums and heritage sites, which have tended until recently to deny all but the sense of sight.
This paper argues that, for Central Mediterranean prehistoric archaeology, there remains plenty of scope to put into practice new
sensory studies: an undertaking whose apparently risky and experimental nature is mitigated by incorporating sensoriality into
the full range of existing archaeological methods.
