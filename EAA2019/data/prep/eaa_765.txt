EUBOEANS IN CORFU? THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ISLAND’S CULTS AND THEIR ARCHAEOLOGICAL
EVIDENCES

Presentation Format: Poster
The topic here presented is part of a wider PhD project on the archaeology of cult in Corfu and its peraia from the 8th to the 4th
cent.B.C., aimed to investigate worships attested on the island and in its projection on the mainland, and their archaeological
evidences. Among literary sources, Plutarch is the only one attesting an Euboean presence on the island of Corfu before the
Corinthian foundation of Kerkyra. The lack of archaeological data of this proto-colonial phase has been connected by some scholars to the nature of the Eretrian presence, very brief during the 8th cent.B.C. and that has never resulted in a real settlement,
but, on the other hand, it has been used as the main argument by those who deny any proto-colonial Greek settlement on the
island. If the absence of archaeological data directly connected to an Euboean phase before the Corinthian colony is absolutely
undeniable, some cults and mythologies attested in Corfu seem to refer to an Euboean origin and they can support the Plutarch’s
notice about the Euboeans in Corfu. For some of them, as for instance Aristaeus and his daughter Makris, we can clearly follow
their persistence and how they have then become part of Corinthian mytological references. For others, especially for some of
the main worships of the island shared by both the Euboean and the Corinthian pantheon- as Hera or Apollo-, we can instead only
find some Euboean rather than Corinthian aspects of the worship. The aim of the poster is then to collect all these cults and
mythological references and their archaeological evidences, in order to better understand their role in the wide debate of the
Euboean presence on the island.
