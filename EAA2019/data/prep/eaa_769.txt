As something that does not tend to leave direct material traces, sound is not often considered in archaeological work. However,
it was an important aspect of ancient life that can be investigated using a new approach to the archaeological remains. When
taking this understanding of sound into account, it seems surprising that important public spaces in antiquity, such as performative spaces, have been investigated almost exclusively with a focus on their visual function as spaces in which individuals or
groups display and experience their collective or personal identities and status. Only by acknowledging, investigating, and recognising buildings and performative spaces as embodied spaces and ‘sensory artefacts’, based on their physical structures and
the way sound reacts to those structures, can we begin to understand sound perception in these places of the past and its complex relationship between buildings, spaces and social interactions. This proposal aims to explore the reasons that led ancient
cultures to create these spaces, as well as reconstruct how they experienced them by analysing both the physical acoustics and
the way these acoustics shape what people perceive.
