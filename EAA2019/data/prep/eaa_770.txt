Phenomenological interpretations of past landscapes have been proposed for at least 25 years, however, very rarely this epistemological approach has taken into account multisensorial experiences other than those embodied by archaeologists themselves. On the other hand, ethnoarchaeology, ethnohistory and direct analogies have also been privileged methods of interpreting ancient cultures but most of them have focused on the concreteness of material culture.
In this paper, developed under the Artsoundscapes ERC project (https://www.facebook.com/artsoundscapes/), we propose
a combined methodology where the intuitive and empirical knowledge of past soundscapes is revalued in the light of the information given by ethnohistorical and ethnographic sources. We propose to link ethnography and phenomenology to connect
multisensorial lifeworlds and soundscapes with modern bodies through technology, and to enhance data gathering in the field.
Finally, this proposal discusses how to avoid the cultural evolutionistic implications that often derived from this direct comparison through some case studies about the relationship between indigenous communities from Namibia and Siberia and their
soundscapes.
