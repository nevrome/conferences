through the reconstruction of ancient instruments, while new multisensory approaches to ancient ritual take into account space
in which music and sound may have played a particularly important role. Aligning with recent research on ancient sound, this paper aims to bring to the forefront the importance of sound in ancient Greek cultic practices. The first part of this paper draws on
epigraphic, literary and archaeological data to demonstrate the importance of sound in ancient cultic practice through several
case studies. It examines the importance of sound at sites of cult practices in Dodona in Epirus (where a prophetic oak tree that
answered agonizing questions by rustling its leaves, and priests made prophecies by de-coding the sounds of bronze cauldrons
and the cooing of pigeons) and on Delos (where the mingling of many dialects and different languages constituted a form of
homage to Apollo). The importance of sound within cultic space is also relevant to recent studies on caves. The second part of
the paper relies on new approaches in sensorial studies to reconsider three ancient sites, the layouts of which seem to indicate
a possible use of acoustic devises to enhance the cultic experience: the open-air rock sanctuary at Strophilas (Andros), the dark
winding stairwells (so-called labyrinths) in the temple of Apollo at Didyma, and the underground corridor beneath the temple of
Apollo on Claros.
