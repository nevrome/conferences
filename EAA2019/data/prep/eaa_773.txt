This paper will present the soundscape of public festivals in Athens from the Archaic to the Classical times. Music, songs and
other musical performances took place during feasts, mainly religious, celebrated in honor of various deities, such as Athena,
Apollo, Dionysus and Hephaistus. Music-making/playing in honor of the gods at procession and sacrifice was very important.
These ceremonies accompanied by musical instruments, singing and dancing. Musical contests were also included, mostly at
the beginning of the festivals. All citizens of the polis participated active at the celebrations. The traditional feasts followed the
time’s trends: their ”artistic” program was adapted to the time; it became richer included new competitions in musical instruments, dances, songs, or literary genres. One observes a continuity, renewal and expansion of the program. Music was sounded
in free spaces (streets or sanctuaries) or also indoors (odeia). The sounds of Auloi, kitharai, and salpinges dominated; lyre, krotala, tympanon and other instruments were also used. The sounds of music, dance (e.g. pyrrhic or ecstatic), songs, recitation and
other performances composed a charming, unique soundscape in Athens during the festivities.
The presentation focuses in feasts in honor of the city-patron, the goddess Athena (Panathenaia) and of the god Dionysus (Dionysia en astei). References in written sources will be compared and combined with archaeological finds: representations of
musicians, singers, dancers and other artistic performers on vase paintings or reliefs and remains of musical instruments will
contribute to reconstruct an image of the soundscape in Athens during these festivals.
