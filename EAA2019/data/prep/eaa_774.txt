ANCIENT PERCUSSIONS

Presentation Format: Oral
Archaeology and organology studies of Ancient percussion instruments or sound objects help us to better understand and
achieve sounds heard by Ancient populations. Faced to literary and iconographic testimonies, archaeological data could assist
us to distinguish physical soundscape depictions to ethical and moral considerations, even if both might be linked. In the Ancient
Roman soundscape, such drums artefacts seem to play various similar roles: signals intended to the gods and / or humans, protection, healing, votive offerings, etc.
This paper will examine the potential constants (or differences) between percussion instruments by putting them back into the
global ancient anthropophony(1) as foreground sounds(2) and soundmarks(3). Effects produced by sistra, cymbala, tympana or
crotala are more understandable by contextualizing them into a general archaeological landscape. In this way, we can realize, for
instance, that apotropaic and prophylactic aspects come from the material or the movement rather than from the sound itself. In
other words, we analyze what a percussion foreground sound means for Ancient individuals. We’ll also discuss the importance of
percussion instruments as soundmarks for the communities within the global Roman world. Indeed, such objects – even not only
because of their sound characteristics – are identities markers, especially of religious or political ones.
