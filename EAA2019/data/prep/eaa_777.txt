community focus such as religious building or public square; a domestic zone; a peripheral zone for activities such as dumping of
refuse or threshing grain; the infields; the outfields; and the so-called ‘wilderness’ or ‘wasteland’ beyond. These can sometimes
be distinguished by the changing character of built structures and by the decreasing density of artefact scatters.
What really characterises these zones in terms of lived experience, and enables communication across and between them, is
sound. For historical periods, these can be reconstructed with the help of the archaeological material, oral history and historical
documents. Again, from the centre, they might include calls to prayer, noisy families in their courtyards, the rhythms of flail or
threshing sledge, the work of the plough team (people, animals, plough), and the communications and daily rhythms of herders,
hunters, gatherers and travellers. One key aspect is the elaborately intertwined relationships across the socio-ecological communities made up of humans, animals, plants, soil, water and weather, all of which have their own characteristic sounds.
I will demonstrate these ideas by mapping the concentric sounds of an Ottoman-period settlement lying on the interface of
mountain and plain in the Northern Troodos mountains of Cyprus. By listening to the aural symphonies and dissonances that animate these different parts of the landscape, I intend to redraw the connections between places, people, and more-than-human
others in our shared world.
