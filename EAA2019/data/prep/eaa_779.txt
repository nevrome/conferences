Our knowledge about the rock art of California is mainly concerned with the visual nature of the panels depicted in caves and
shelters of both Mexico and the USA. Senses other than vision are largely ignored, even if anthropologists indicated that music
and songs have been systematically present in ritual. Recent studies have also demonstrated that many rock art sites around
the world are indeed located in places with special acoustics. In short, the literature pertaining to the new field of archaeoacoustics strongly suggests that rock art landscapes were not perceived as “dead silent” by their creators. What about ancient
Californian soundscapes? Is there any possibility that rock art and ideas on sound and/or music were related in this specific
region? This paper is the result of a research that is being undertaken in the Artsoundscapes ERC project and it aims to provide
new perspectives on the understanding of the Californian past through a multidisciplinary perspective. The study of sources
from missionaries and more recent ethnographers will allow us to inquire into the place given to sound and/or music in ancient
Californian societies, especially in a ceremonial context. Also, we will establish a list of pre-Hispanic musical instruments from
sources such as chronicles and archaeological reports and collections. Finally, we will reflect on the similarities and differences
in the field of ancient soundscape studies between both Californias whose border is a recent invention in spite of their prehistoric cultural similarities.
