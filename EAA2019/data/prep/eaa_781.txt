actively in its formation, complementing with the sounds produced by himself the environmental acoustic background.
But: how can we approach the intention of, for example, a maker of a musical instrument which has been found in archaeological
excavations?This question is particularly important in the case debated in the present text: the presence in the archaeological
records of instruments, whose sounds exceed the limits of reception of the human ear. In this precise case, it is a set of ceramic
rattles from the medieval period, found, among others, in funerary contexts in the territory of present-day Poland. The acoustic
analysis of this set of objects revealed, that apart from a quite weak sound audible for humans, they present a strong signal in
the frequencies between 17 and 22 kHz. Is this an intentional effect on the part of the craftsman, or a purely fortuitous effect?
It seems, that the first option is the correct one: an attempt to extend the sound landscape and to cross the horizons of sensory
experiences.
