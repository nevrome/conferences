RINGING ROCKS AND SINGING SAND DUNES: A SURVEY OF INTERCONNECTED SONIC LANDSCAPES IN
NORTH AMERICA’S GREAT BASIN

Presentation Format: Oral
Worldwide rock art research has more often than not reinforced connections between the occurrence of parietal art and places
with novel echo properties. In western North America – as seems to be the case in other regions – oral traditions describe this
link between sound and visual culture in terms of landscape animacy. In the Great Basin, aboriginal traditions describe many
landscapes both with and without rock art as supernaturally endowed with voice. From ringing rocks in piñon forests, to resonating box canyons, to singing sand dunes, these sonorous landscapes are tied together by a web of cultural connections. This
paper combines new and previous research to discuss the traditional links between these places in terms of Native American
narratives, indigenous ideology, archaeological evidence, and economic interactions in the Precolonial past. This project’s digital
approach reanimates abandoned landscapes, building immersive virtual tours of ancient, interconnected soundscapes. Analytically, this integration of 3D models with field-tested sound profiles provides a creative tool useful for inspiring continued innovation in research design, theories, and practice. This study of the sociality of soundscapes weaves together theory and virtual
environments, asking “what roles did they play in daily life?” and “how did they mediate ritualized aboriginal political economies?”
