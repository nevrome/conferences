all directions, among others also to the East-Central Europe. It signified the beginning of a great change, which we call “medieval
transformation” (according to J. Klápště). Among significant European sites, which are important to understand the medieval
transformation, is Pohansko near Břeclav. The newest discoveries at Pohansko and in its neighbourhood in the past decade
brought crucial information about the topography of power and to the satisfaction of needs of local elites. Based on current
research, we suppose that here – in the north-eastern suburb (outside the ducal castle) – we found evidence of existence of one
of the oldest noble families in East-Central Europe – its proprietary church and the residence (curtis). Archaeological research
in the north-eastern suburb has been carried out in 2007-2018. This excavation unearthed the foundations of a still unknown
Great Moravian church (rotunda), a church cemetery and a part of the adjacent settlement. Within the area, we identified remains of a palisade enclosure, above ground and multi-space houses, workshop buildings, large ovens – probably from the bakery,
sunken-floored dwellings with an exceptional set of iron tools, which have belonged to the inventory of the curtis, and most
importantly a surface residential dwelling with walled corner. Systematic research was carried out simultaneously in wider surroundings of Pohansko – inside its agrarian hinterland of the centre.
