PLAY & POWER: CASTLES AS PLAYGROUNDS IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD AND BEYOND
Author(s): Hall, Mark (Perth Museum)
Presentation Format: Oral
This presentation will explore a key aspect of the satisfaction of needs within centres of power: play, specifically within and
around castles. Using a suite of examples from across Europe - including Eilean Donan, Dundonald and Sween (all Scotland), Castle Acre and Gloucester (England), Mayenne (France), Alcoutim (Portugal), Castello di Arco (Italy), Malbork (Poland) and Hilversum
(Netherlands) â€“ along with sources such as paintings and written accounts (including the fantastical) some of the rich seam of
evidence for board and dice games in particular will be assessed. Exploring these several strands of evidence for play allows us
to see how the very idea of the castle could be playful and contribute to its rich symbolism as lordly residence and dominant node
within landscapes and networks of power. This fusion of imagination and material culture persists in the on-going use of many
castle ruins as playgrounds long after their political power has ebbed away.
