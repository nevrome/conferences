Southeast Lithuania during the Migration period (mid-1st c. AD). It is argued that in the first region, linear links could have operated effectively and in the second, a lattice-shaped visual communications system is plausible. But in the third, visual signalling
between the hillforts could have hardly been effective. These differences should be associated with both the relief of these
regions as well as different defensive needs. In the first two cases the castle systems functioned over a long period in the presence of constant military threat posed by the Order while the unexpected attacks by wandering marauders in the third did not
lead Baltic chiefdoms to the formation of an early warning system.
