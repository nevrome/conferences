This paper seeks to explore the material background of medieval elite living on castles. Since Frauke Stein’s study about ”Adelsgräber” (1962) a vivid discussion has tried to identify characteristic objects being significant for the upper class in medieval
society. Krauskopf (2006) and Goßler (2008, 2015) classified archaeological findings from castles as being ”ordinary”, ”superior”
or ”outstanding” equipment, which contained ”barometer objects” signalizing a certain status in society.
More recent research has revealed that the range and variety of objects provides an additional signal for an upper class standard
and style of living. This traditional view of wealth visible in refined or valuable objects can be challenged using Rathjes (1992)
concept of ”garbology”, which opens for a radical review of archaeological findings and their interpretation. This competing theoretical approaches will be used for answering the subsequent questions:
•
In how far is it possible to identify objects associated with the users of a castle?
•
In how far is it possible to conclude from archaeological finds to their former owners’ status?
•
What is the relationship between a castle and its hinterland in terms of demand and supply?
