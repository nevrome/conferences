An impressive collection of archaeological artefacts and ecofacts were unearthed during the thirty years of intense archaeological excavations in Vilnius Castle complex (Lithuania). Up to 70 000 mammal and bird bones and their fragments represent
a period of more than 700 years. During the period between the end of 13th– 17th century’s, the castle complex and the Royal
palace in it, were populated by the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It means that zooarchaeological material could be
interpreted as an objective indicator of concentration of the recourses and power.
In our paper we seek to explore and to compare zooarchaeological material from the Vilnius castle complex (which represents
nobility strata) with the analogical data from Vilnius city. As the most obvious reflection of the differences in the socio-economic
capacity of consumers, as well as the unrestricted access to exclusive resources, we decided to investigate the zooarchaeological material related to hunting – remains of wild mammals and birds, dogs and birds of prey.
The results of the research suggest that abundance of large wild animal bones (such as auroch, bison, elk, deer and wild board),
numerous remains of greyhounds and molosser type dogs as well as birds of prey (golden eagle, peregrine falcon, goshawk etc.),
witnesses that Vilnius Castle complex was an extraordinary centre of power.
