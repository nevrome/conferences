Following the conquest of Constantinople during the 4rth crusade in 1204, Latin hegemony was established in major parts of the
dissolved Byzantine Empire. The principality of Achaea was one of the Frankish states that was founded in this period. It engulfed
the Peloponnesian peninsula, in southern Greece, and it was divided into twelve secular baronies, which were subdivided in fiefs,
run by knights. A strict hierarchy consisting of the prince, the barons, and the fief-knights enabled a feudal system quickly to
develop and be imposed on the locals.
The erection of a castle as central landmark of each fief is known from literary sources and archaeological research. Beyond the
castles lay series of villages and small rural sites, strongly connected to the activities of the fiefs and often relocated, in order to
better serve the new masters. Nowadays, one comes across evidence that ranges from standing structures to scattered debris
and pottery in the fields. Literary sources offer additional information about sites that havenâ€™t been discovered yet.
Fieldwork which has taken place in northwestern Peloponnese, within the confines of the barony of Patras, has focused on identifying the implementation of the feudal system at the scale of a fief. Data are drawn from surface survey, and from historical
records such as Frankish estate documents, the Chronicle of the Morea, and Ottoman tax registers. Spatial analysis in GIS is
