pillars. Most of the famous concessive crypts have about four to six ledges, so they are usually built on the mainland.
Among them are Tsarsky, Golden, Melek-Chesmensky, some crypts of the necropolis of Hughes-Oba, ect. Such buildings are
common for 4th century BC Bosporâ€™s funerary architecture. The shape of the burial chamber can be divided into two types:
quadrangular and round.
The largest crypts are the earliest. They have a four-sided overlap. The overlap on three sides is known only in two cases.
The sharp barrow had a stone crepe in the form of an octagon; this has not been recorded on any other Bosporan burial mound.
From its three sides (western, eastern and southern) unusual structures in the form of large stone staircases were included in
the structure of the crepida. Crepids, are revealed in some Thracian mounds.
This innovation was associated with the strengthening of the Thracian influence on the Bosporus, and establishment the Spartokid dynasty. Nowadays, this innovation is attributed approximately to the turn of the 5th-4th centuries BC.
