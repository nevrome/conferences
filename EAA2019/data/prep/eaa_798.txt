Presentation Format: Oral
The Roman Small Town Turicum/Zürich is an epigraphically attested customs station of the Gallic customs district (quadragesima galliarum) – a legal status that is very rarely found for Roman settlements. If the other known Roman customs posts are
taken into account, the decisive factors for the appointment of a customs station become clear, which do not merely seem to be
determined by its size, infrastructure or specific archaeological finds.
Looking at Turicum the attainment of this legal status was undoubtedly the logical consequence of its favourable location in
terms of transport links as well as its emergence from a Celtic oppidum. Therefore, Turicum, in addition to its central function for
the immediate surrounding area, had demonstrably supra-regional significance. While the regional impact can primarily be traced
back to the regional settlement structure, individual finds show its inter-provincial network. A network that goes beyond trade
visits and exchange of goods but requires deeper cultural exchange.
The presentation aims to discuss the legal power of a Roman Small Town and its manifestation in archaeological evidence and
the surrounding settlement landscape. However the question remains if legal status and power are connected in ways that are
traceable archaeologically?
