Presentation Format: Oral
Ancient cities offer a research framework for understanding different power strategies which coexist to some degree in a same
society. Thus, through architectural analyses, this paper explores the political transformation of Teotihuacan, Mexico, from the
period 1-250 CE. This Mesoamerican urban settlement reached c. 125,000 inhabitants around 250 CE and had a multi-ethnic
population and a corporate society. Studying its political transformation can provide valuable insights into economic and social
aspects such as the satisfaction of needs. During this time range, changes in Teotihuacan architecture display the emergence
of a corporate power strategy. This fact is related to a higher standardization of construction materials, building techniques and
orientations, and to a new form of urban residence. In addition, cityâ€™s growth intentionally destroyed agricultural soils for urban
purposes. However, a new food supply system was successful, since Teotihuacan continued to grow until 550 CE. In sum, the
purpose of this paper is to discuss the political transformation of the city and how affected its hinterland.
