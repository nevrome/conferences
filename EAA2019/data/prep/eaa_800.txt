Format: Regular session
Archaeometallurgy is a multidisciplinary field populated by researchers with varying biographies. Some archaeometallurgists
have their background in science or engineering, and focus on scientific analysis of metallurgical samples. Others prefer an experimental approach, trying to reconstruct ancient techniques and technologies through practical work. And some archaeometallurgists have a background in the humanities or social sciences, trying to understand metal objects and metal-working from a
theoretical or cultural history point of view, or to fit them into historical narratives. Although many agree that a multidisciplinary
approach would be ideal, we do not always find practical ways to combine our different approaches. A major obstacle seems to be
the lack of a forum for different types of archaeometallurgists to exchange ideas, to develop overreaching research strategies
and to develop a common ‘language’.
In this session we welcome papers on ancient metalworking in a very broad sense. We particularly appreciate contributions that
address questions or provide examples on how to integrate different research traditions, that show how the same material can
be studied from different angles. In addition, we would like to discuss the difficulties that may arise when archaeometallurgists
