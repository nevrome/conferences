Our project studies the spread of the products and technology of copper metallurgy in the Carpathian Basin. The current presentation discusses the first results on the provenance of copper artefacts from Western Hungary in the Early-Middle Copper
Age (4350-3800 BCE). This was the earliest period from which traces of local metallurgy was found in Hungary, in a territory
laying far from raw material sources. Our multidisciplinary research team integrates various methodology (lead isotope and trace
element analysis, Bayesian modelled AMS dating, and network analysis) to reveal the spread of the products and the technological knowledge of copper metallurgy. This case study shows results from two sites (Zalavár-Basasziget and Zalavár-Mekenye)
which are located very close to each other and represent two consecutive periods in the Early and Middle Copper Age. A unique
copper disc and flat axes were found in the earlier, Zalavár-Basasziget settlement and small copper ornaments and a crucible
were revealed in the later, Zalavár-Mekenye settlement. The first few data indicate that the raw material sources used in the two
periods did not change. This requires a new interpretation of the process of knowledge transmission. The project is financed
from the NRDI Fund (NKFI FK no. 124260).
