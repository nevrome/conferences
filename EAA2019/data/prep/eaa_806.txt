PRIGGLITZ-GASTEIL (AUSTRIA)

Presentation Format: Oral
The late Urnfield period (c. 1000-900 BC) mining site of Prigglitz-Gasteil is the largest copper production site at the eastern end
of the Greywacke zone (north-eastern Alps). Excavations are ongoing since 2010, revealing the full chaîne opératoire of metal
production on-site. In the frame of an FWF-Project, the site is comprehensively studied: slag analyses, metallographic analyses,
lead isotope analyses and chemical analyses characterise the remnants of the different production steps from the ore to the
final metal object. The site itself is studied by means of radiocarbon analyses, archaeobotanic analyses, charcoal identification,
geochemical analyses, geoelectric analyses and core drillings in order to provide a holistic picture of life and work at the mining
site and to provide information about the extended chaîne opératoire of metal production, as food and fuel supply, organisation
of mining activities and mining venture. Hence, this project acts as an example of a perfectly working cooperation of experts with
different background all working in the field of archaeometallurgy.
