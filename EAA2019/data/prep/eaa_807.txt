There are two distinct frameworks in which prehistoric metallurgy is studied: a material framework and a social framework. The
former is universal, the latter contextual. Typically, these frameworks have little to no overlap in terms of methodologies, focus,
and understandings. In this paper I propose a third a third framework: the psychophysical framework. This framework takes into
account prehistoric skill, cognition, and the senses.
I will introduce the methodology of perceptive categories through which an empirical analysis of skill is achievable, taking European Bronze Age metalworking as a case study. Based on scientific data provided by the material sciences, in this case compositional and metallographic analyses of Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age axes, the thresholds to categorise and interpret
these data, and organise them in a chaîne opératoire, are centred on the human senses—and thus on metalworking as a craft.
This is a pragmatic approach that appreciates scientific measurements of metal objects as essential empirical evidence whilst
recognising that a considerable share of these archaeometric data are inapt or too detailed for an understanding of skill. After
all, the qualities and behaviour of a material are a sensorial reading of the properties from which they stem. These two knowledge
identities must be compatible with each other; they only make use of a different type of categorisation. Science and craftspeople are not describing different realities; they are simply describing reality differently.
