Recent excavations and geophysical surveys at the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age Teleac hillfort, jud. Alba in Transylvania found a
large specialised area for high temperature production activities in the northern part of the settlement. The area had the remains
of several fire installations of various types, including a well-preserved updraft kiln for pottery production, as well as a building
adjacent to the fortification system with several ovens and hearths, burned soil, charcoal and ashes. The building also contained
slag and technical ceramics used for metal casting, which indicate that it was a metal workshop. Comparable finds of production
areas in settlements from this period are very rare in south-eastern Europe and not much is known about the structure and organization of production activities. We will investigate what materials were worked in this workshop and how important it was for
the economy of the settlement using archaeological, geophysical and archeometallurgical methods.
