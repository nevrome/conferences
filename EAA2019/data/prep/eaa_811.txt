“Iron is one of the most important commodities in the world. The development of technologies for processing of iron is even considered as one of the most important steps in the history of mankind. The beginnings of this technology can be found in the Near
East but still are a topic of controversial discussions; crucial questions e. g. about the social and technological circumstances
could not be answered conclusively yet. This desideratum is due to the circumstances of especially poor preservation of iron
objects, which made it difficult to carry out archaeometallurgical studies. However, refined possibilities enable better scientific
analysis.
Due to a rather famous letter (KBo I.14) Kizzuwatna, the ancient region of Cilicia,Turkey, was regarded as the earliest production
area of utilitarian iron even before the beginning of the Iron Age, a theory that is believed not without controversy today.
Aim of the thesis is a detailed study on the development of early iron metallurgy in Cilicia based on archaeological and philological
methods supplemented by scientific analysis of the artifacts. The objective is to analyze the factors of production and economy
for both the cause and the impact of the adaption of iron technology on the one hand and the social conditions and consequences of this technological change on the other hand.
In this paper, the results of the analytical research conducted on objects from Sirkeli Höyük will be discussed. By the use of analytical methods like pXRF, XRD, SEM-EDS and optical microscopy it is possible to gain more information about the manufacturing
techniques as well as the possible provenience of the mostly rusty bits and pieces of iron.
