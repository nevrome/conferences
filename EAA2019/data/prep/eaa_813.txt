The Iron Age in Central Europe is highly dynamic space and time, with widely discussed mobility of people, ideas and their expressions in form of artefacts. Due to the long tradition of archaeological research of this period, a unique possibilities for application
of archaeometric analyses of its abundant material culture developed over the years. However, unlike in the periods from the
beginnings of metallurgy, there has been much less attention given to the Iron Age on account of supposed impossibility of gaining the unbiased data due to a complex economy that was characteristic for this period. However, we believe that a large-scale
sampling of copper alloys across different social and historical settings does have a great potential to give us a new and unique
perspective for reviewing the traditional narration given by archaeology and authors of the classical antiquity. As the general
trends in approach to important materials are best revealed in comparison, different socio-economic environments and longer
chronological period are being sampled and analysed in the framework of our current project dealing with the archaeometry of
coppers alloys in Central Europe between the 4th and the 1st century BC/AD. Our approaches involve bulk and trace compositions together with both common and unique isotopic or elemental tracers. In this paper we would like to discuss the feasibility
