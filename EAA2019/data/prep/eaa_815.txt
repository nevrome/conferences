Scholarship has focused on the Gupta age (ca. 320–550) as the quintessential expression of classical Indian art, and on the key
role of metal icons in the dissemination and development of Buddhist and Hindu practice during that period and its aftermath
into the eighth century. In fact, although well attested in contemporary texts, few bronze figures, and none in gold or silver,
survived the decline of Buddhism and the destruction of monasteries during the Muslim invasions, and for those still extant,
little attention has been devoted to their manufacture. Close examination of a group of hollow-cast bronze Gupta-style Buddha
images from North India has revealed a unique technological style developed to meet the particular challenges of producing
three-dimensional, but relatively shallow, figures wearing expansive monastic robes. Unlike most figural metal statuary, the Gupta-style images were cast in a horizontal orientation, with internal gates that directed the molten metal laterally into the billowing
draperies. These and other conclusions regarding their manufacture are based on visual examination, computed radiography, volumetric X-ray imaging, and X-ray fluorescence analysis. The spread of this technology to South India and Southeast Asia parallels
the wide ranging propagation of the Gupta style, but the specialized knowledge necessary to produce such images points to the
movement of experienced craftsmen between these regions and the Gupta heartland.
