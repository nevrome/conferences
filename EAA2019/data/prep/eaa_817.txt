3D laser scanning is a non-destructive and versatile technique that provides archaeologists with new opportunities. In our paper,
we explore the utility of 3D modelling as a analyzing tool for copper alloy objects and casting moulds from the Viking world. Our
pilot studies show that 3D modelling is a valuable tool for iconographic documentation, artefact reconstruction and production
analysis. Results from these object studies also pave the path for novel and creative research strategies. For instance, 3D-laser scanning on debris from an early workshop site at Ribe led to a re-assessment of the chronological relationship between
different production phases. This produced a substantially clearer image of this rare episode of metal casting and motivated a
revaluation of the scale and time frame of the workshop activity. In consequence, 3D-model-based analysis appears to be useful
for answering traditional questions in Viking Age artefact studies, and may also inspire innovative approaches when combined
with other methods.
