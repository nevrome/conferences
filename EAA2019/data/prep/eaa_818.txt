This study concerns metallurgical examination of iron artefacts excavated at the 4th – 12th c. site of Tortuna, Sweden. During
the 4th – 7th c. Tortuna was a settlement location with a farmstead and a pagan cult site. Although the farmstead was abandoned
in the early 7th c., the cult site continued to be used and was later expanded. The pagan cult site was eventually abandoned when
a Christian church was erected around the 11th – 12th c. Various iron artefacts have been encountered at the site, including
common utility objects such as nails and horse cleats, weapons/tools such as knives and spearheads, and ritual objects such as
amulet rings. Our metallurgical results show a large range of craftmanship and material qualities in these items. Some were made
from relatively soft and carbon-free ferritic iron, while the knives were skilfully made from hardened steel. Two spearheads had
been coated with a thin layer of rather pure copper, likely for aesthetic reasons and possible ritual use. The copper coating had
been applied in a molten state, demonstrating the capability of brazing at temperatures of at least 1100 °C. The high material
quality of the steel knives raises the question why so many other objects were made from low-quality iron. The reasons for these
material choices are discussed in relation to the possible uses for the studied objects and the work effort needed to improve
the material quality.
