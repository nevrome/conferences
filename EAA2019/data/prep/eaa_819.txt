WORKING INTERDISCIPLINARY – KING CANUTES WORKSHOP IN VIBORG
Author(s): Jouttijarvi, Arne (Heimdal-archaeometry)
Presentation Format: Oral
The investigation of a late Viking Age workshop in Viborg in Denmark was made some years ago, but ca still serve as an example of
a very successful interdisciplinary collaboration. The collaboration included, in addition to an archaeologist, also an archaeometallurgist, an archaeobotannist and a dendrochronologist. In addition, there were a number of minor contributions from researchers, which, for example, looked at waste from comb production and on remnants of spiders.
By combining the data generated by the various disciplines, it was possible to follow the workshop’s history in detail, from being
built in 1018, over a three-year period of use between 1019 and 1022, after which the building lay unused but still remained
maintained until 1025 when it was demolished. It was only used during the winter months, while in the summer plants grew in the
floor layer. It could also be seen that repairs were made, among other things, of the roof.
It is possible that the workshop, which is just one of several in the area, can be linked to Canutes return to Denmark in 1019-1020,
in order to secure his power as king.
