HUMAN BEHAVIOUR IN METALLURGICAL STUDIES; THE CASE OF A VIKING-AGE BLACKSMITH

Presentation Format: Oral
Excavations of an 11th century, Viking-age, metalworking site and associated cemetery uncovered the remains of two blacksmiths along with their rich grave finds. The location, at Raatvere, Estonia, alongside the banks of lake Peipsi, placed them directly in contact with one of the great riverine trade routes between the Scandinavian world in the North and the Byzantine world, far
to the south. As no metal ores are mined in the region, the copper-alloy that made the weapon and belt fittings, bracelets, strapends and other personal adornments must have originated some distance away. Were these craftmen local? or had they come
to Raatvere from somewhere else, perhaps along the long distance trade route? Could anything be gained from establishing the
composition of the copper-alloys that contributes to their archaeological story?
This paper explores some metallurgical approaches to exploring these Viking age objects, starting with a non destructive pxrf
survey that determined their basic characteristics.
