Metal wire is in modern society produced by drawing metal rods through tapered holes of increasingly smaller diameters. The origin of this wire-drawing technique is unclear, and has been a topic of interest for over a century: Heinrich Schliemann stated that
the gold chains he and his wife Sophia found at Troy were made by wires that had been drawn, while Sir Flinders Petrie held that
all ancient wires he had observed in Egypt displayed evidence of hammer blows. Current evidence suggest that the wire-drawing
technique was invented somewhere in Europe during the 1st millennium AD, replacing earlier techniques for the manufacture of
gold and silver wire such as hammering, block twisting, strip-twisting, strip-drawing, and roll-drawing. Many of the earliest tools
for wire-drawing have been found in Viking Age Scandinavia, possibly suggesting that this is where the technology was first
developed. The Scandinavian tools were made either from iron or from bone/antler, and the wires drawn were typically made from
silver or tin. Here, we describe the current understanding of the origins of Scandinavian wire-drawing, and present new results
based on SEM-EDS analysis of wire-drawing tools.
