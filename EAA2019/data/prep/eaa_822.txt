As known, the blacksmith’s craft was one of the leading branches of the ancient economy. The possibilities of studying various
aspects of the history of this production have greatly expanded with the introduction of metallography into archaeology. The
Laboratory of natural science of the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences has a great base of archaeometallographic analyzes, which allows to solve both technological, and cultural and historical problems. On the basis of the analytical data characterizing the smithing artifacts of Ancient Rus, we were able to establish that the Ancient Rus blacksmithing craft
was based on the interaction of two technological traditions: the Scandinavian and Slavic ones. For the first, the technology
of the so-called three-fold welding was typical, for the second, the technology of welding-on. The Scandinavian tradition most
clearly manifested itself in the emerging urban craft (IX – XI centuries). Its introduction had an explosive character, but did not
have a significant impact on the further development of the Ancient Rus blacksmith’s craft. Slavic tradition spreads gradually
and finally replaces the Scandinavian tradition in the XII century. It turned out to be more sustainable and retained its value until
the beginning of the industrial production of iron objects.
