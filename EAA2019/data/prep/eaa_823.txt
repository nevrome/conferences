Presentation Format: Oral
There is various ways and materials in castle building. Some were built of wood, some of stone, or bricks, and some of all before
mentioned materials mix. During building process all these materials in one or another way were connected to each other.
It is known that iron in building castles in Lithuania was started to use in 14th century by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Due to that
and because of The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Teutonic order conflicts there was some Teutonic Oder castles built in 13th –
14th century at the nowadays territory of Lithuania.
The aim of this presentation is to compare the iron used in building castles by Lithuanians and by Teutonic Oder at the Lithuania
territory in 13th – 14th centuries. It is expected to present the differences and similarities between used iron material and findings (especially the ones which were used during building process) and also to answer to the question: is it worth of interest in
research?
