The study of artefacts provide knowledge of various life’s aspects of our ancestors. It is extremely important in the discovery of
their everyday activities and works, like making and using various tools. The development of craftsmanship that accompanied
the development of societies is also possible to be recognised through the archaeometric research. The results of such investigation answers many general questions: ‘what’ (raw materials identification), ‘how’ (manufacturing process), ‘why’ (functional
analysis). Such studies are significant part of considerations concerning the economic status as well as the level of craftsmanship, e.g. sewing and shoemaking. Within this research, not only the investigations on the artefact relicts (fabrics, knitwear,
leather) but also on the tools are carried out. In the Middle Ages and the Early Post-Medieval period varied groups of tools were
used during the textile and leather working. In this group were generally iron and steel scissors, shears, different types of knives,
awls, needles as well as pins or thimbles (made of copper alloys). The aforementioned artefacts from Poland were analysed by
various metallurgical methods (SEM-EDS, ED-XRF, OM and metallography). The selected methods are non-destructive or less
invasive, which is important for the studies of cultural heritage.
