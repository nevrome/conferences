The surface of archaeological metal is valuable in terms of information. Platings and decorations may still be present on artefacts from precious metal from a marine context in a nearly pristine state, compared to historical objects. Corrosion often
hinders the identification of the original surface with the unaided eye. Consequently, the establishment of the ancient metalworking techniques that have been used is not optimal. In this research, multiple non-invasive analytical techniques that extract
information have been applied to precious metal objects that have been salvaged from the sea. This presentation will focus on
the possibilities and limitations of these techniques. Examples are X-ray imaging, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), micro-computed
tomography (Î¼-CT) and neutron tomography.
The artefacts studied in this research are recovered from a 17th century shipwreck that contains many other objects from dif-
