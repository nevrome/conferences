THE BIRINGUCCIO LADLE – THE USE OF WRITTEN SOURCES IN ARCAHEOMETALLURGY
Author(s): Jouttijarvi, Arne (Heimdal-archaeometry)
Presentation Format: Oral
The results of metallographic analysis are often interpreted from the viewpoint of a modern perception of materials and processes. However, this may often be misleading as the raw materials in the past were often different in composition and form. At the
same time, the perception of which characteristics was of importance was often different from what it would be today.
One example is a casting technique, which seems to have been widely used from 14th to 16th century, but which has hitherto
apparently avoided being noticed in archaeological excavations. Probably because it differs greatly from the methods you normally imagine from the period.
Glazed fragments of clay with copper traces were thought to originate from furnaces used for bronze casting. However, on the
basis of Birringuccio’s ”De la pirotechnia” from 1540, they could be interpreted as fragments of a form of ladles. That is, large
open crucibles made from plain clay in an open basket of iron. Heating took place as known from the Bronze Age, by burning charcoal on top of the crucible. Not, as otherwise known from the Middle Ages, by charcoal lying around the crucible. Interpretation
might not have been possible without the written source.
