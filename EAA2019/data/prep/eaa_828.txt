The appearance of iron items in the cultures of Bronze-Iron Ages had place from the Ural to the Carpathians during 3-1st millenniums BCE. The investigations of iron technology of different cultures developed in this time on this territory are very important.
The reconstruction of iron elaboration from using meteoric iron to bloomery iron process, the chronology of development of
iron technology, influence of paleoenvironment on spreading of this technology allows to give the answer on such significant
question: was the eastern Europe one of the independent centrum of Iron metallurgy in the Ancient World or appearance of iron
was connected with Cimmerian and Scythian influences. Such research is very actually because of the new Russian idea about
the “transition period” between Bronze Age and Iron Age in the “system of three Ages” of Christian Jürgensen Thomsen. The first
results of iron object compositions from main archaeological sites of the Eastern Europe (such as Butor, Saharna – Moldova, Boldirevo –Russia) were obtained. For investigations the complex of methods: thin section analysis, geochemical and mineralogical
analysis with using of SEM-EDX, XRF and MS had been applied.
