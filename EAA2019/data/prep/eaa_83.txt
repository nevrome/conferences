organization of the space, the latter reflect repeated activities performed in a given space. Therefore, different methodological
approaches to distribution analysis, from simple graphical representation to geostatistical analysis, have prompted different
interpretative models of the spatial organization and patterns of use. However, the vast majority of the studies have focused on
well-preserved suddenly destroyed contexts close to the “Pompeii premise”.
This presentation seeks to give a critical review of the use of intra-site spatial analysis to understand social patterns of behaviour. Cases-study from Italy and the central Mediterranean, either characterized by sudden destructive events or progressive
growth of refusal elements, will be specifically discussed. The significance and suitability of both types of contexts as pointers
for socially accepted behavioural patterns will be also investigated. Furthermore, a focus will be addressed to the spatial analysis of botanical and faunal refuse, proxy data for a wide range of human activities of production and management of primary and
secondary goods.
