Both historians and archaeologists are concerned with documenting and explaining long-term change. Yet, there is surprisingly
little exchange between the two disciplines and both have cultivated different concepts, theories, and visions of the ‘long term’.
This situation is understandable in so far as the often-divergent nature of historical and archaeological evidence affords different perspectives and interpretations, but it is also problematic, as each discipline may be diminished by failure to productively
engage with the other. Moreover, there appears to be a growing transdisciplinary consensus that phenomena of the ‘long term’
should be distinguished from their ‘short term’ counterparts. In historical research, for example, the theme of ‘scale’ has become
prominent, with scholars beginning to reflect more deeply upon the internal dynamics and dialectics of varying temporalities of
change. In a similar vein, archaeologists have started to expose diachronic patterns and asymmetries shaping long-term trajectories and to explore emergent configurations of stability and transformation which cannot be explained only by short-term
processes. Key notions such as ‘temporality’, ‘causality’, and ‘historicity’ arguably must be re-considered in this light. What is
the specificity of long-term phenomena? What are the mechanisms that drive them? What is the ontological status of long-term
patterns? What is the relationship between regional and global histories of long-term dynamics?
