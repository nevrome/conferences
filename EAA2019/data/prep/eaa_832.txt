ONTOLOGIES OF TEMPORALITY

In 1953, the anthropologist of Aboriginal Australia WEH Stanner wrote an essay entitled ‘The Dreaming’. He concluded that: “The
value given to continuity is so high that they are not simply a people ‘without a history’, they are a people who have been able
in some sense, to ‘defeat’ history, to become a-historical in mood, outlook and life.” We must be wary of the term ‘a-historical’,
which is culture and time bound in a distinctively modernist framing. Have Aboriginal ontologies indeed defeated ‘history’? Arguably the study of the deep human past has defeated the discipline of history. While many historians still define their discipline as
a study of change, others note that it is inevitably a study of the present, framed by present questions and concerns. This paper
suggests that focussing upon change may thwart a historical study of the deep past, which on the continent of Australia, may
be better told as a story of continuity. Drawing upon Francois Hartog’s Regimes of Historicity (2015), I also note how anthropologists Claude Levi-Strauss and Marshall Sahlins offer useful perspectives on the relationship between history and society. The
paper then considers whether Australian indigenous ontologies, especially their approach to a long term, multi-layered temporality, may not actually ‘defeat’ history, but rather, may offer enlarging opportunities for the future of the discipline.
