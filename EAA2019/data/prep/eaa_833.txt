Maropeng is the only known open-air Earlier Stone Age site in the Cradle of Humankind, South Africa, which is estimated to
cover an area of approximately 191200m². Archaeological material was accumulated over time from the surrounding landscape
through low-energy slopewash, creating a sealed artefact-bearing horizon through colluvial processes. From the geoarchaeological work, it is evident the artefacts derive not from a single depositional event but accumulated from various higher points on
the landscape within 1km. The nature of the horizon means it is not possible to date the deposit, and that small pieces have been
winnowed from the assemblage while pseudo-small flaking debris is present from in situ quartz breakage. This study aimed to
identify technological episodes in the deep past along with an assessment of the biased nature of the deposit. A description of
the site context and material will be presented, and a discussion as to how the authors went about using a technological reduction analysis of larger stone tools like cores and large cutting tools (LCT) to interrogate temporal episodes in the ESA and assign
material to the relevant techno-complex. The technological patterns that were used for this show a dominance of simple reduction strategies and limited raw material exploitation that was restricted by tabular blank shape. However, a small percentage of
the cores shows a more organised arrangement of flake scars, indicating that the stone tool makers were capable of overcoming
the limitations presented by raw material blank shape. Taking into account the significance of temporality of the site and these
reduction patterns helped the authors determine the Early Acheulean assignment at Maropeng.
