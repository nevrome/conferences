‘CIVILISING PROCESS’

The comprehensive investigation of ‘long-term’ phenomena is complicated not only by what can be called the ‘problem of intuitive grasp’ but also by an overwhelming diversity of approaches and concepts of possible relevance, without much conceptual
clarity and understanding of how they interrelate. This paper argues that due to this condition, the synergetic potential of key
concepts from different schools of thought has hitherto largely been overlooked. In an attempt to overcome this deficiency, I
propose that the notion of ‘civilisation’ coined by Elias and Febvre in the context of structural history and figurational sociology,
the idea of ‘niche construction’ advocated by Schrödinger and others and presently experiencing a second advent in modern
ecological-evolutionary theory, and the concept of ‘path dependence’ originally developed by Arthur and others in historical
economy and organisational sociology can profitably be integrated to more effectively examine emergent patterns of the deep
past. The paper outlines the core insights of each of the three notions and draws out the synergetic relationships between them.
As a proof of concept, I re-visit the classic Upper Palaeolithic sequence from Western Europe and show how a combined application of the three concepts may enrich our apprehension of this certainly critical time frame in early human evolution.
