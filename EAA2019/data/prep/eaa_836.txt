This paper argues that material culture transformation can be understood as the transformation of the way human beings and
material culture mutually open up their potentialities. Such opening-up/becoming takes place in the domains of their encounter,
which often take the form of human communications. In communication, human beings and material culture mutually mediate,
intervene, and/or transform their modes of existence through coping by the former with various uncertainties and risks that the
world generates and that communication differentiates. By drawing upon the sociologists Niklas Luhmann’s theory of communication and social systems and Deleuze and Guattari’s theorization of the ‘Diagrammatic’ mutual constitution of subjective and
objective factors, the paper will elucidate and elaborate on this perspective through examining the long-term transformation of
the mode, or the diagramatic constitution, of such mutual opening up/becoming by human beings and material culture of their
potentialities, that took place in the Jomon and the Yayoi periods of Japan.
