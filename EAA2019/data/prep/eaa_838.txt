texts of the middle and late Bronze age in the Southern Urals area. This model allows an overview over different aspects of burials
(grave goods, grave construction, spatial context, corpse preparation, etc.), but raises new questions as well. Results show
changes and continuums in burial customs in this area over a range of about 500 years. Many aspects of funeral culture turned
out to be part of gradual, long-term developments overarching different cultures. This paper will describe main aspects of Bronze
Age burial customs and their long-term developments and discus possible motivations and intentions behind them.
