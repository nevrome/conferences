The Iron Age in Scandinavia was characterised by periods of continuity, interrupted by times of rapid change. A marked shift
visible in the archaeological record from the mid-6th century AD seems to be related to a substantial social reorganisation. Moreover, the detectable changes in artefact categories have come to define the transition from the Early to the Late Iron Age (500
BC–AD 550/AD 550–1030). Crises, as well as long-term processes, have been suggested to lie behind these changes. However,
recent studies have acknowledged both temporal and spatial variability within the archaeological record, providing more nuanced and complex interpretations. During this transitional period kitchen technology went through considerable change when
a long-term tradition of high quality pottery production ended giving way for a larger variation of vessels, cauldrons and frying
equipment of soapstone and iron. The last few decades have seen a noticeable broadening in archaeological approaches to food
and kitchen technology in the understanding of prehistoric societies and social change. Moreover, complex understandings of
change have been developed through approaches addressing the relational properties of entities and the absence of “clean
transitions” between phases. In this paper I address the dialectic between long-term and short-term change through the perspective of food technology. Through a diachronic and relational approach, I explore kitchen utensils and types as historically
situated emergent assemblages.
