and political relevance of our discipline. The multi-temporality and pluralism of archaeological approaches can give valuable contributions to the current debates and to the key set of ideas on the following subjects:
•
Deconstruction of sexual versus gender relations in different times and places based on the empirical record (domestic contexts, funerary spaces, shrines and rock-engraved art);
•
Engendering the Past: Women and figurative representations, power and ideology in non-literate societies.
•
New insights into theoretical issues, methodologies and high tech archaeological science tools (materials science,
ecological analysis, DNA and isotope analyses, organic residue analyses of prehistoric pottery) that can bring to the
fore crucial situations of social inequality.
