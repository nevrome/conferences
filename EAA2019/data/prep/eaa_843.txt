Author(s): Soares, Joaquina (University of Lisabon)
Presentation Format: Oral
The aim of this session is to enlarge and conciliate archaeology with the great problems of the contemporary world, strengthening the social commitment and political relevance of our discipline.
Gender frontiers are a standing operative mechanism that divides Humanity in two opposite and conflicting halves during a so
long paths that deconstruction process must be continued, in a global and plural perspective.
Case studies, regional or worldwide visions from social integration of sex/gender relations can be of crucial importance to understand current gender inequalities and inter-sexual violence that crosscut quite different social formations.
Since the decade of 1970 a significant number of archaeologists have been participating into the debate on women discrimination, both in the past reconstructions and in the discipline itself. Nowadays archaeology provides new insights into theoretical
issues, methodologies and high tech science tools reinforcing its active role on the research about the future of un(gendering)
social relations of production and reproduction.
