WOMEN AND ARCHAEOLOGY. AN APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF FIGURATIVE REPRESENTATIONS
Author(s): Escoriza-Mateu, Trinidad (University of Almeria)
Presentation Format: Oral
In this essay we tackle the study of archaeological Figurative Representations. To that end, we propose the use of theoretical
and methodological strategies which may be far from relativist universalist and essentialist positions, because it usually shows
the collective social and sexual subjects associated with unavoidable fates. Therefore, we would like to raise the need for an
archaeological theory that do not allow arbitrary and pre-constructed studies. We argue for an archaeology like social science
committed to improving the living conditions of women and men in society. Hence, for address the problem of idealism and prevailing androcentrism, we claim the no-sexist use of scientific knowledge, and appropiate methodology. Moreover, we consider
that Figurative Representations studies promote -due to the conservative presence of the Capitalist and Patriarchal Archaeology- the strengthening of perverse and misogynous stereotypes. An alternative Feminist perspective in Archaeology is required,
with a Sexuate Past as objective of research.
