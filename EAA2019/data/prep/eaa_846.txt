WHO IS THE WOMAN IN ASHURBANIPAL’S GARDEN AND WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE?:
DECONSTRUCTING NEO-ASSYRIAN ROYAL NARRATIVE
Author(s): Zhao, Jianing (Princeton University)
Presentation Format: Oral
The “Banquet Scene” relief from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal has long been considered one of the most remarkable and
enigmatic subjects in ancient Near Eastern art, known for its jarring depiction of the defeated Elamite king’s head hanging on a
tree during the Assyrian royal feast. Much scholarship has been devoted to the garden landscape where the feast takes place,
but little on the gender dynamics at play. A consensus about the queen’s identity has not yet been reached, as most scholars
assumed that she is Ashurbanipal’s wife, while some have suggested that she might be an Elamite queen or even a high-ranking
eunuch Schmidt-Colinet 1997). [1]This paper aims to offer a new, gendered reading of this famed relief, by shedding light on the
queen’s identity and function through cross-cultural and transhistorical contextualization of her iconography, as well as bringing
into attention the hitherto neglected figures of the female attendants in the scene, to deconstruct the discourse of domination
ofthe women and throughthe women as part of the Assyrian visual propaganda.
