CRAFTING RELEVANT STORIES: STEPS TOWARDS A SOCIALLY ENGAGED URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY
Theme: Global change and archaeology
Organisers: Jervis, Ben (Cardiff University) - Baumanova, Monika (University of West Bohemia in Pilsen)
Format: Regular session
This session explores how we can re-imagine the public benefit of urban archaeology (across any time period or location) in light
of the increasing adoption of field and digital technologies which enable the development of ever more ‘high resolution’ understandings of past urban societies. Contributors are asked to explore ways in which archaeological data might be used to open
new areas of research which address or align with the concerns, identities and challenges of contemporary urban communities
such as environmental sustainability and resilience, migration, and social inequality.
An ambition to engage archaeological research in other policy areas to maximise its public benefit is a key pillar of the EAC’s
Amersfoort Agenda. This framework, when coupled with innovative research approaches in urban archaeology, which include
methods as wells as innovative cross-disciplinary research questions, creates potential to stimulate the closer alignment of
archaeology with the wider field of urban studies on any continent. This, it is proposed, would have the effect of changing how
we understand archaeology’s public benefit, by creating possibilities for the findings of archaeological work to have direct and
tangible impacts on decision making by urban communities outside of the limited scope of heritage management.
The intended outcomes of the session are to:
•
Debate how archaeological techniques and perspectives can be applied in innovative ways to address questions of
broad relevance.
•
Explore how the concept of public benefit in urban archaeology might be re-imagined through the use of archaeological
data to better understand the dynamics of urban communities and to have a tangible impact on urban decision making
in the present.
•
Present best practice examples of how the public and urban practitioners in other fields might be engaged in the
co-creation and communication of archaeological research which resonates with, and addresses the concerns of,
contemporary urban societies.
