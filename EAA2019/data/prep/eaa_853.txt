European and African towns that flourished in the early modern era between the 15th and 18th centuries, and which spatial
organisation featured an inner partitioning into smaller units. Specifically, I focus on how natural topography such as hills and
rivers, or human-built features including public buildings, were incorporated into the logic of urban spatial organisation, economic
life as well as negotiations of social power. The goal of the presented arguments is not to derive a normative classification of the
analysed towns, but rather to propose that to reach a sustainable balance, urban settlements in various parts of the world have
employed sub-division into smaller units constituted materially within their spatial layouts.
Considering historical maps, survey layout plans and satellite photography it is argued that the complex urban systems of access points, routes, public spaces, landmarks or building material bear importance beyond material symbols and economic aspirations, and realise their full significance as components in diverse urban system. Understanding this process from the perspective of long-term global experience is relevant for debating social connotations of spatial (im)balances associated with present
and future urbanism.
