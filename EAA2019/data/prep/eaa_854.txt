The rationale for undertaking archaeological research in advance of development is the ‘public benefit’ of heritage preservation.
In this paper I propose that the concept of public benefit is under-developed in terms of the ways in which we might use archaeological data from urban excavations not only to understand the development of urban spaces but to address challenges faced
by urban communities today. In particular, I will propose that the long term perspective offered by archaeological research means
that our data can provide valuable contributions to debates on urban governance and the resilience of urban institutions. The
implications of this contention will be explored using the example of English medieval towns and the ways in which they were
able to adapt to challenges faced by their communities, including environmental change, political tension and the environmental
implications of urban living. The paper will also argue that in order to maximise the public benefit of urban archaeology new and
imaginative research frameworks are required, which can help to embed concern with how archaeological data can address contemporary challenges into professional practice.
