SCOTLAND

Govan Old is an ancient church site housing a large collection of early medieval sculpture that originally graced the royal burial
ground of the kingdom of Strathclyde. This kingdom ceased to exist in the 12th century and gradually disappeared from popular
consciousness. In time, Govan was reborn as a powerhouse of naval engineering; for a time in the 19th century, Govan was the
greatest shipbuilding centre in the world. Those days of industrial greatness are also slipping into the past.
This paper explores how the archaeological resources of Govan Old can be used to rekindle local awareness of the past and
rebuild community self-confidence. The two activities are part of a long-term project of building conservation, heritage creation
and urban regeneration. One is a documentary film involving local school children which uses archaeology as a means of engaging
them in their history and transforming their perception of their home from one of marginality to one of significance. The second
element engages members of the local community in the active co-creation of 3D records and interpretations of eroding burial
markers in the churchyard. The results of this portion of the project will be assessed in terms of its effectiveness in engaging
younger members of the community in this more recent part of their local heritage.
