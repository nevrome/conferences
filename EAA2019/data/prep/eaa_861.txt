practices. The socio-economic and cultural issues thrown up by the globalization phenomenon have been explained by social
scientists mostly on the basis of causal factors rooted in present time. In his book, Runaway World: How Globalization is Reshaping our Lives, Anthony Giddens argues that it is the information revolution which is transforming the world. It is my submission
that the phenomenon of globalization also needs to be understood in deep time perspective. Therefore the role of historians and
archaeologists. I have recently argued that the first three centuries CE are witness to the economic integration of the Indian
Ocean world in a way which was unprecedented. Never before had so many polities competed for fruits of international trade as
it happened in the early centuries CE. Never before had so many trade ports opened and so many goods circulated. Never before
had so many crafting and trading communities become involved in the exchange networks from the Red Sea to the South China
Sea. The Indian Ocean world came closest to experiencing the phenomenon we call globalization today. I have also argued that
the globalization of the ancient Indian Ocean world between 1st-3rd centuries CE was building up through the preceding centuries. And, of course, we see the impact of this globalization in the creation of new techno-cultural traditions, migrations and art
in the centuries after. Therefore, in my proposed paper, I will try to establish – through specific highlights – that a retrospective
view of the Indian Ocean past may help us negotiate the rapid undercurrents of present day globalization.
