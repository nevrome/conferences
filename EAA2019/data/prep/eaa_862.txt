GALVANISING GLOBAL NETWORKS: THE USE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIAN OCEAN GOODS IN
PTOLEMAIC EGYPT AND THE PRE-ROMAN MEDITERRANEAN

An increasing number of modern scholars have sought to explore the financial and social impact on the Roman world of goods
imported via the Indian Ocean trade network between the 1st-3rd centuries AD. Within this body of scholarship there is a growing
and arguably accurate tendency to conceptualise Rome as the centre of only one region or ‘province’ of a more ‘global’ economy
(Fitzpatrick 2011). By contrast, modern scholarship has yet to fully explore the significance of the Ptolemaic era activity in the
Red Sea and instead has tended to assume that trade during this time was small-scale and relatively limited in social impact both
within Egypt and the wider Mediterranean world.
Therefore, this paper will, by utilising a range of source material (particularly inscriptions, literature and papyri), argue that the
goods imported into Egypt via the Indian Ocean trade, while quantitatively on a smaller scale than during the Roman period, made
a lasting impression both on Ptolemaic society and the wider Mediterranean. Particular attention will be given to the diffusion of
these Indian Ocean goods and the range of purposes to which they were put. A more in-depth exploration of this earlier Ptolemaic
activity will allow for the subsequent, increasingly “globalised” integration of the Roman world into wider Afro-Eurasian networks
to be better contextualised.
