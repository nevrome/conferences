The study of the ancient Indian Ocean world has received increased interest in the last few decades thanks to the increasing
volume of new archaeological and textual information unearthed at various international sites. It is rightly the case that a great
deal of attention has been directed to what this evidence can tell us about the operation of the ports, the trade’s organisation
and funding, the types of commodities exchanged, as well as levels of “state” interest in this activity. More recently, an increased
focus on the cultural dynamics of this exchange and its consequent impacts on intellectual, religious and social developments
within various polities offers a valuable additional avenue with which to assess the significance of global interconnections in
antiquity.
It is argued in this paper that one useful tool for the historian and archaeologist interested in these Indian Ocean interconnections is transcultural theory. Principally by considering the impact of a new geographical and cultural context on how items of
exchange were understood, appreciated and became re-contextualised. This paper focuses on the appearance of goods from
the Mediterranean world in various areas in South Asia (and parts of Central Asia) during the early centuries CE. The array and
distribution of different types of finds across the Indian Subcontinent is such that an exhaustive treatment is not possible here.
Instead a few case studies will be examined, specifically: 1) the importation and consumption of Mediterranean wine in India; and
2) the use and adaptation of Roman aurei and denarii in an Indian context. The aim of the paper is to look beyond the perception
of these items as mere prestige objects, items of consumption or stores of value, and consider their potential social and ritual
significance in their new context.
