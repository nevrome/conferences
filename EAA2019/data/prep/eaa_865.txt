cient writers and the Periplus Maris Erythraei reported had long vanished or become impossible to provenance. Some luxurious
ivory ornaments had been found, but none pinpointed Indian craftsmanship. Instead this 24 cm tall female figure is the first - and
to date only - object securely traceable to India prior to AD 79.
Perhaps because until recently most scholars have been expert in either Indian or Greco-Roman art, the statuette has been under-studied and under-published. Archaeological excavations in India (e.g. Arikamedu, Kolhapur, Pattanam, etc) have highlighted
Roman exports to India. However this paper attempts to rectify the misperception that lack of artifacts in the West signifies lack
of activity, creating a fuller picture of this unusual object, the embodiment of globalization, and rare only by default.
This paper attempts to reconstruct the path from creator to end user in a cosmopolitan world, imagining the 6000 km journey
the statuette might have made from southern India to Pompeii, updating iconography and function debates, and putting the find
spot debate to rest. Moreover this paper highlights specific artifacts in the storerooms of the National Archaeological Museum
of Naples as well as interesting footnotes in previously published papers which could benefit from fresh study in light of emerging interests in globalization.
By delving deeper than previous scholars into just one object, this paper opens the possibility for further material evidence of the
active trade across seas and oceans, two millennia ago.
