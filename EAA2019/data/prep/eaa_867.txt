GLOCALIZATION, POWER, AND RESISTANCE: THE LATE BRONZE AGE IN THE NORTHERN LEVANT

Presentation Format: Oral
The concept of globalisation is based on the idea that the world is seen as one place, however, it does not imply a unified society and culture. Studies of globalisation often focus on a broad geographical range, but globalisation can be an effective tool
in understanding local interpretations. For instance, shared practices are not identically replicated everywhere and increased
contact can provoke resistance. Engagement at a global level can lead to a clash of cultures that results in attempt to re-define
boundaries between the different groups.
The Late Bronze Age in the Northern Levant is often considered as the “International Age”, however, studies often draw attention
on the shared practices while neglecting the differences. This paper will present the work in progress results of a case study
dealing with the interactions between the Late Bronze Age empires and the local population in the Northern Levant. In particular,
this paper will focus on the analysis of the Late Bronze Age pottery from the site of Alalakh/Tell Atchana (Turkey) to understand
the impact that the Mitannian and Hittite empires had on ceramic use and production on the site and to explain material change
in the Northern Levant during the Late Bronze Age.
The study will engage with changes in the pottery typology, production and standardization as well as changes in social habits
and behaviours within the balance between global and local networks.
