mations in the Japanese archipelago. The cultural fluorescence of Middle Jōmon central Honshu underwent a collapse and reorganization into more decentralised settlements. Mobility increased as Late Jōmon influences spread from eastern into western
Japan, and populations expanded to offshore islands such as Okinawa and the Kurils. In Kyushu and other parts of western Japan,
the eastern Jōmon expansion was associated with the cultivation of adzuki and soybeans but there is no evidence for the introduction of cereal crops at this time. Here, we discuss connections between the Eurasian mainland and the Japanese Islands
ca. 3500 to 900 BC. Our analysis concludes that the transformations in Jōmon society during this period were at least in part
a response to contacts with Eurasian Bronze Age cultures. Although prehistoric Japan was one of the most isolated regions of
Eurasia, we conclude that the historical evolution of societies in the Japanese archipelago after the third millennium BC was
linked with processes of Bronze Age globalisation.
