This paper focuses on Early Christian architecture in the territory of Kosovo in a global context. Kosovo lies on the southeastern part of Europe, precisely on the Balkan Peninsula, putting the country at a favorable geographic and geopolitical position.
Consequently, the process of Christianization reached this region relatively early. The written sources confirm that the earliest
traces of Christianity are the first martyrdoms, Florus and Laurus, in the roman city of Ulpiana in the 2nd century AD, while the
first traces in architecture from Ulpiana date from the 4th century AD. The objective of this paper is to present concrete examples of Christian architecture in Kosovo under the lens of globalization. Through comparative analysis of the design method and
construction techniques of these buildings, we can observe how Christian architecture was subject to globalization process of
this period. Concluding, through these examples we can acquire a greater understanding on the ways that the global trends of
the Early Medieval period in architecture were adapted to local conditions in form of new shapes and styles in the beginning and
how the ambitions of the emperor Justinian affected the architecture in quantity and quality centuries later.
