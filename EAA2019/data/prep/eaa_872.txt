PRODUCTION

Presentation Format: Oral
When the Portuguese first arrived in South America, massive changes started to occur when their culture clashed with the
indigenous natives that already inhabited the continent. The introduction of the logic of mercantilism, of currency, and European
styles, paved the way for new relations of power that up to that point did not exist in Brazil. These new demands and concepts
created significant changes in the material culture encountered in the region.
The Great Iberian Navigations was the first time that global economic transformations started to occur in the Americas. And the
introduction of mercantile enterprises, with exploration of a whole new continent within a global scale economy produced massive changes in the way the world functioned, and an even greater impact in native societies that already inhabited theses lands.
In this paper we will address the colonial pottery unearthed in the city of São Paulo, that dates back to the first century of occupation in the region (mid 16th to mid 17th c.) , and show how the pottery production in the city developed a unique style, with
European shapes and techniques, but with indigenous forms of decoration.
