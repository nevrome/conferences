We will argue in favor of the theory that these styles of decoration (incisions, grooves and engobes) are forms of indigenous
cultural resistance in a European colonial system that thrived on native slave labour. These forms of resistance would once again
occur with the introduction of enslaved African labour, and would be persistent during the whole colonial experience. Therefore,
we will be able to discuss some of the impacts of globalization and European influences on traditional native ceramic production.
