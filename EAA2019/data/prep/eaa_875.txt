The South-Eastern Alps represent one of the richest areas in Europe for its Mesolithic record. In fact, some hundreds of sites and
find-spots spanning from the main valley bottoms to the Dolomite highlands are currently known. As regards the former, these
are mostly represented by rock-sheltered sites that were interpreted as mid-to-long-term residential settlements although recent studies revealed a high specialisation degree of at least part of them. The highest density of sites can be found in the uplands. These are mostly interpretable as hunting-oriented camps and stands clustered along the tree-line zone (1800 - 2300 m
asl). As pointed out in previous studies, such location seems to correspond to a deliberate strategy aimed at the exploitation of
the Alpine forest-grassland ecotone. Evidence of human presence in-between these two altitudinal zones, on the other hand, is
quite scarce. In this paper, currently available data on the occupation of midland territories will be questioned in order to assess
how these areas could be exploited by the last European hunter-gatherer groups and infer their role in the settlement strategies
of the Alpine region.
