High altitudes are often regarded as pristine, marginally modified by human activities. The main practice traditionally carried out
at high altitude is pastoralism, perceived as a very conservative, extensive and low-impact practice: a strategy that is perfectly adapted to the environment and that does not transform the essential character of montane landscapes. Archaeology and
palaeoecology have long dismissed this common perception, demonstrating that pastoralism have significantly contributed to
shaping high mountains since the Neolithic. However, pastoral practices transform over time, and their evolution acts as a critical driving force for land-use and land-cover change. Therefore, the impact of pastoralism on ecosystems and landscapes should
not be perceived as a homogeneous process (exclusively related to the increasing or decreasing intensity of animal husbandry),
but as a “punctuated equilibrium”. This concept, borrowed from evolutionary biology, describes systems that go through a series
of transformative events (‘tipping points’), which tear the deep structure of these systems and enable the formation of new
