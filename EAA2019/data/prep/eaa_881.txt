ones. In this paper, we will use the “punctuated equilibrium” paradigm to interpret archaeological, historical and palaeoenvironmental evidence from the high altitude areas of Val Molinac and Val Poré, in Val di Sole (Italian Alps). This approach will lead us to
investigate how the profound transformations of pastoral strategies occurred in the 15th and early-19th and mid-20th century,
have transformed the impact of livestock-grazing on high-altitude environments and cultural landscapes. The inferences provided for the historical period will be used to rethink human-environment interaction at high-altitude in the late-prehistoric period
in the same study-area. The outcomes of this study will improve our understanding of the impact of pastoralism on the ecology
and historic character of the Alps.
