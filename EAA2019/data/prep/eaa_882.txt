The radiocarbon dating of sheep remains found in a chasm located at 2,200 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Western Alps sheds new light on
the issue of protohistoric summer pasture and land use in an alpine environment.
The Giétroz Devant chasm (located in the small valley of Susanfe in the Chablais Alps), discovered in summer 2017, contained
abundant and particularly well preserved faunal remains. The bones were identified as belonging to ibex, chamois and sheep.
About fifty wild and domestic ungulates were accidentally trapped in a fault of the karst system. Radiocarbon dating shows that
this kind of trapping happened from at least 6500 BC until 50 BC. All the sheep samples (five individuals) can be dated to 200-50
BC. These results provide evidence, for the first time, that the Celtic tribe of the Nantuates brought herds to alpine summer pastures. The age and sex distribution of these sheep yields precious indications for our understanding of Late Iron Age pastoralism.
This presentation also aims to incorporate these results in the archaeological context of the Upper Rhône Valley.
