The National Park of Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici is located in the Central Pyrenees (Spain), in a high-altitude mountain
zone. During the last 15 years, the Grup d’Arqueologia de l’Alta Muntanya research group from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona has carried out archaeological surveys and test excavations that provides a large and quite continuous sequence of human
occupation from the Mesolithic to the 20th century. In this area is possible to observe signs of seasonal herding management
that are quite different from the extensive transhumance recorded by the ethnographic sources. Furthermore, it is possible to
observe other activities such as agriculture or coal yard.
This paper presents the results of an investigation that involves the architectural characteristics of open-air structures, the
ethnoarchaeological modelling of traditional land uses and use Geographical Information Systems to explore spatial relationship
between the archaeological sites and its surrounding environment and other signs of human occupation in the surrounding areas. In addition, the palynological data obtained in the territory has been integrated to analyse the social construction of mountain
landscape considering human and natural insights in a long-term perspective, from Prehistory to Modern Age.
The results of these investigations show how human groups inhabited the high mountain environments and their relationship
