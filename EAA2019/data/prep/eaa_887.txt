This paper presents preliminary results of the environmental project conducted in Sudeten in 2016-2019 (nr 2aH 15 0283 83).
During the excavation of Early Middle Ages sites samples were taken for palynology, gas chromatography and for microscopic
examination of plant remains. Palynological studies, in addition to the reconstruction of the character of the nearest environment, indicated the possibility of collecting plants for the purposes of herbal medicine (accumulation of pollen within individual
features). Such accumulation was observed in the interior of one of the residential buildings, where a high amount of pollen of
dandelion, lapulla squarrosa, asteraceae and hawkweed was found. In the second case, a very high amount of lime pollen was
found, which could be used for the production of infusions. Furthermore pollen analyses were used to indicate the marginal role
of agriculture in the mountainous areas and the existence of large tracts of meadows within forest clusters. Additionally gas
chromatography tests, based on the samplen taken from pottery, were applied to determine dietary components as well as to
identify the compositon of tar production (mostly on the vegetable basis). The presented analyses allow the reconstruction of
the human shaped Sudeten mountain ecosystem in the Early Middle Ages.
