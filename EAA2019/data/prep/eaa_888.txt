Applied to archaeological sites, the essence of biological memory consists in the following. Human activity is accompanied by
the input of specific organic materials into the soil. These organic materials are subsequently lost due to their complete mineralization by soil microorganisms. Despite the fact that organic substances had been decomposed, the information about their
income may store in changes of soil microbial communities and enzyme activity and these changes can be preserved up to now.
Soils and occupation layers of settlements represent a natural experiment with well-known place, time, and nature of anthropogenic activity. Their study allows evaluating the peculiarities of transformation of soil microbial community.
The aim of this work was to study the effect of farming practice on soil properties and evaluate the peculiarities of changes of
microbiological and biochemical soil properties.
Objects of studies were: (i) agriculture terraces in mountain Dagestan (North-Eastern Caucasus) (1st millennium BC â€“ 1st millennium AD); (ii) soils around archaeological sites (AD 200-800) and (iii) ancient stone corrals (1400-1200 BC) that are situated in
the Kislovodsk basin (North Caucasus, Russia).
