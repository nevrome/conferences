Farming practice with long-term manuring in the past had led to significant changes in soil microbiological properties. Application
of cattle manure had led to a change in microbial biomass and enzyme activity. High levels of enzyme activity (phosphatase,
urease, cellulase, and chitinase) and abundance of thermophilic microorganisms allowed us to reveal places of cattle keeping
and boundaries of medieval agriculture fields.
Thus, our work shows that the information about entering into the soil organic substrate can be stored in soil biological memory
for about 3000 years. However, the time of keeping the information about human activity is seem to be much longer.
