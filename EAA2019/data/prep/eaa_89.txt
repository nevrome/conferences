Author(s): Runge, Mads (Odense City Museums)
Presentation Format: Oral
The Viking Age ring fortress Nonnebakken is placed in and primarily under a modern-day city and only visible for the trained eye.
The fortress has been known from historical maps and excavations for centuries and recent investigations have proved that
itâ€™s state of preservation in many ways is excellent. The new research results have been the starting point for a revitalization of
Nonnebakken in research and dissemination.
One focus point is a series of new research activities in the form of excavations, natural sciences and non-destructive analysis. The fortress among others is part of a large research project analysing the cultural landscape perspective, e.g. of defence
systems in the Viking Age. One of the major results in this perspective is a new view on the nearby and wider hinterland of the
fortress. Important new knowledge is the status of the fortress as part of a geographically widespread system with a series of
various components and the systems coverage of both land and water ways.
Another focus point is a new and better presentation and visualization of the fortress on site and a continues work for bringing
the fortress to the mind of the locals in terms of ownership and proudness of the place associated with the Viking Age background. An important point here is the ambition to apply for status as World Heritage Site as part of a serial nomination.
A third focus point is dissemination of the fortress in its cultural landscape setting. Here three major events have been conducted. One was concerned with the signal lines, the beacons, of the Viking Age from the coast to Nonnebakken, another illustrated
the importance of Viking Age ships and the last will focus on the archaeological elements in the nearby hinterland to Nonnebakken.
