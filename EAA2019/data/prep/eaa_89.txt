Presentation Format: Oral
The Viking Age ring fortress Nonnebakken is placed in and primarily under a modern-day city and only visible for the trained eye.
The fortress has been known from historical maps and excavations for centuries and recent investigations have proved that
it’s state of preservation in many ways is excellent. The new research results have been the starting point for a revitalization of
Nonnebakken in research and dissemination.
One focus point is a series of new research activities in the form of excavations, natural sciences and non-destructive analysis. The fortress among others is part of a large research project analysing the cultural landscape perspective, e.g. of defence
systems in the Viking Age. One of the major results in this perspective is a new view on the nearby and wider hinterland of the
fortress. Important new knowledge is the status of the fortress as part of a geographically widespread system with a series of
various components and the systems coverage of both land and water ways.
