Bohemia region in the central part of the Czech Republic is bordered by mountains (Šumava Mountains on SW). These mountains
were rarely populated until the early 19th century. So called Medieval colonization of Bohemia didn´t reach such high altitudes as
the woodcutters colonization at the turn of 18th and 19th centuries.
The contribution deals with the Šumava Mountains in the SW Bohemia and the phenomenon of woodcutters colonization in the
19th century, which was inducted by the industrialization of Bohemia. The mountains were a „storehouse“ of fire wood for lowland factories. Fire wood was primarily needed for industrial enterprises in Prague.
Thanks to this colonization so far only very little man-affected landscape had undergone great changes. We can still see the influence of 19th century woodcutters activities in the landscape today. It affected not only composition of tree species, but also
entire ecosystems of a large area. The case study focuses on landscape changes, new settlement patterns and water works
(incl. canals) for timber navigation which shaped the current cultural landscape of this mountain region.
