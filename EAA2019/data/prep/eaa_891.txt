Geoarchaeological investigations of pastoral livelihood structures in high mountain regions not only pose challenges in the field
but can also imply issues in remote sensing. The main objective of the study is a scientific insight into pastoral land use strategies in the semi-arid high mountains, particularly for archaeological purposes. In Azilal, a district of Morocco in the High Atlas, the
Aït Atta pastoralists used, and to some extent still use, the summer pastures to sustain their pastoral mode of life as they did
for centuries. In combination with the results of geoarchaeological prospections carried out in the study area in the year 2017,
the application of GIS and remote sensing techniques proved to be a valuable part of the survey. Taken the extreme mountainous
terrain conditions into account, the use of standardized radiometric indices, e.g. the NDVI Normalized difference vegetation
index, combined with a semi-automated structure detection, was a preferable toolkit to conduct a land use pattern analysis.
The results give a scientific view on past and present ways of pastoral land use and constitute the basis of future GIS/remote
sensing supported geoarchaeological research in the study area.
