ALPINE ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTHCENTRAL ALASKA

Presentation Format: Oral
The alpine zone is one of the least understood zones in terms of prehistoric use. Recent work in ice patches in Yukon Territory,
Canada and the Central Alaska Range and Wrangell-St. Elias in Alaska, United States, have contributed to understanding seasonal migration, hunting in the alpine zone, and dating the appearance of arrows. However, much less is known about sustained use
of mountainous areas and trail networks in Alaska. The Chickaloon Trail, approximately following the Matanuska River, served as
an important migratory pathway between the Copper River Valley and Cook Inlet. But until recently, no prehistoric remains were
recorded in the mountains along this trail network. Ahtna and Denaâ€™ina place names coupled with recent ethnographic interviews
clearly demonstrate an intimate familiarity of the eastern Talkeetna Mountains. Site distribution and artifact type demonstrate
continuity of use for millennia by Alaska Native people. The eastern Talkeetna Mountains were more than a migratory route, but
also part of home.
