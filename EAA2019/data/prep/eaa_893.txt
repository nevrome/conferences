Presentation Format: Poster
My archaeology PhD thesis aims to document the occupation and the exploitation of the mountain during the Middle Ages from
the study of two neighbouring valleys of the Ecrins massif (Freissinières and Argentière-la-Bessée, Hautes-Alpes, France).
This project aims to study this mountain territory from the bottom of the valley to the peaks (from 1200 to 3000 meters). My
research is based on important works led since the 1980s on the environment, the landscape and the anthropisation of the
mountains. This is a good time for gathering the available data and nourishing them with new elements. The aim of this new interdisciplinary research is to lift the veil on certain components of the medieval society, the peasant world, on the activities and
on the landscape. Thus, this work addresses the character of mountain settlements, economic activities and mobility (housing
and production places, humans, herds, products…). The Ecrins massif is an invaluable “living laboratory” to observe the evolution
of the land use strategies since medieval times. Indeed, this territory offers the opportunity to cross archaeological, written,
paleoenvironmental and bioarchaeological sources. In order to study the character of agropastoral sites, I will use an exploratory
approach which involves coupling archaeological and geochemical methods. Finally, this research will document vertical land use
on mountain environments in the Middle Ages, offer a land use model and bring elements of comparisons to think about the link
between societies and environments.
