Presentation Format: Oral
The study of larger neighbourhoods, city blocks or residential quarters in ancient and Mediaeval cities may be conducted in various ways, using a new theoretical approach, a specific scientific method, or testing several methods to be able to evaluate these
methods and the possible diverse results that may lead to new ways of archaeological analysis, and promote studies on ancient
cities as living entities, created by their inhabitants.
Cities may be studied as structural units, streets, gates, wells, walls, windows, entrances and floors, but also as decorative units,
with painted wall surfaces, covered floors, wooden ceilings and panels. Another aspect concerns the study of the functions of
various spaces, connected both to the availability of water, light, fuel, streets, storage, and the design of these specific structures. An approach may constitute of a study of a group of objects in a city complex, or, the distribution of graffiti or popular
mythological motifs in a Regio or adjacent city blocks in Pompeii, providing a way to come nearer to the ancient way of reasoning
and the use of space, the ancient methods of living.
