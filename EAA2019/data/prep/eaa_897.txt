Arguably, in Vesuvian cities the housefloor finds are a type of evidence that mirrors most accurately the 79 AD living conditions
and their short-term changes. However, the material studies have traditionally adopted typological approaches, and only in recent years, several projects have published finds also in their context of household or insula.
The present paper aims to discuss Pompeian city blocks or insulae as clusters of finds. In this Vesuvian city, the most drastic
diffrences between various insulae are related to their excavation date, as the early excavations tended to leave many groups
of finds unregistered, or the originally listed finds cannot any more be identified at the deposits of the Archaeological Museum
of Naples. However, despite this caveat, as a methodological consideration, what question can or should be addressed to the
housefloor finds at the level of insula? The most common approach to the finds has, by now, been at the level ofone habitation
unit, that forms a closed and independent household. What types of quantitative or qualitative differences between the finds in
the insulae in various zones of the city could give meaningful results, relative to actual differences in lifestyles, professions or
social statuses in its quarters?
