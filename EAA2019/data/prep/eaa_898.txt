BY BAFFI. PRELIMINARY REMARKS
Author(s): Bellucci, Nikola (University of Bern)
Presentation Format: Oral
In the context of the papers of the famous classic philologist Pasquale Baffi (1749-1799), most of which today held in the National Library in Naples (BNN), this brief contribution will present preliminary remarks on an unpublished document concerning a visit
to Pompeii, discovered among his dossier. In fact, the text represents one of the very few attestations within the Baffi corpus of
his visits to the site of Pompeii demonstrating an unknown interest that the scholar had about the ancient city. Other documents
show, moreover, that Baffi, as a member of the Herculaneum Academy, was often invited to Pompeii to allow study, especially
to foreign scholars, such as G. ZoÃ«ga. Through a quick analysis of the document in question, it will be then provided brief critical
and interpretative commentary notes to the text, which, although partially, thus results an important and further practical and
descriptive document of the Pompeii of 1784.
