Another focus point is a new and better presentation and visualization of the fortress on site and a continues work for bringing
the fortress to the mind of the locals in terms of ownership and proudness of the place associated with the Viking Age background. An important point here is the ambition to apply for status as World Heritage Site as part of a serial nomination.
A third focus point is dissemination of the fortress in its cultural landscape setting. Here three major events have been conducted. One was concerned with the signal lines, the beacons, of the Viking Age from the coast to Nonnebakken, another illustrated
the importance of Viking Age ships and the last will focus on the archaeological elements in the nearby hinterland to Nonnebakken.
