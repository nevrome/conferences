In a recent PhD project the completely excavated insula 30 of the Roman colonial town Augusta Raurica (Augst/Kaiseraugst, CH)
has been in the focus of an archaeological interpretation.
Centrally situated in the Upper Town of Augusta Raurica, the block (50 m x 60 m) known as Insula 30 was completely excavated
between 1959 and 1962. Insula 30 is, so far, the only insula in Augusta Raurica that has been excavated in its entirety. Almost the
entire area of 3,400 square metres was excavated down to the underlying natural subsoil, allowing not only the floor plans of the
stone-built phases to be recorded (1st â€“ 3rd century AD), but also the remains of its timber-built phases of the early 1st century
AD. Therefore the whole development of this city block can be reconstructed.
The overall analysis aims an understanding of the functionality of this city block. In order to obtain results on the interaction with
the urban surroundings computational methods, e.g. Space Syntax Analysis, has been applied. This not only gets us insights
into the internal and functional organization of an insula but also knowledge about the relation between architecture and urban
context.
