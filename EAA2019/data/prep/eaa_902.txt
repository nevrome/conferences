Presentation Format: Oral
The so-called House of Cantaber is the largest domus excavated so far in Conimbriga (Lusitania province), the most renowned
Roman city in Portugal. With a total area of 3260 m2, the house occupies a whole block in a central area of the Roman city. It was
discovered in the 1930s and partially re-excavated in the 1990s, when it was possible to date its construction to the end of the
1st century CE, being in use at least until the 6th century CE. Although its remains are visible, they are not so easy to read due
to the poor state of conservation of some structures, the early 20th century restorations, and the lack of detailed chronostratigraphic information in some areas of the building.
This work aims to describe and analyse the two latrines identified on this domestic space. Furthermore, it will present for the
first time a planimetry and a detailed graphic documentation of these structures. Both latrines are located in areas of the building
close to the street, with easy access from surrounding roads, which makes us think of a ”semi-public” use of these spaces. The
one located in the west wing presents more problems of interpretation due to the current state of the archaeological remains. In
contrast, the one on the east side shows a fairly good state of conservation. They represent unusual examples of Roman latrines
with two different internal spaces (separation by sex?), although sharing the same drainage channel.
The location and design of these latrines allows us to reflect upon the management of physiological waste in both private and
urban spaces during the Roman period.
