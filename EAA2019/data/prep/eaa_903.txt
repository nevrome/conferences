HOUSING THE DEAD

While not intra muros, the cities of the dead offer their own building blocks of ancient cities. The necropoleis were not simply
a place to deposit the dead. In one sense, they reflected the living city and formed part of it, but they also had an existence
of their own. The necropoleis take many forms, but in the present context, the Northeast Necropolis of Hierapolis in Phrygia,
Turkey, is a highly useful point of departure due to its organization and layout. Hierapolis had several necropoleis with slightly
different chronologies and attachments, so to speak. The Northeastern Necropolis developed from the 1st century AD, and
shows a change from the earlier, usually elaborate and more monumental graves erected individually, found predominantly in the
North Necropolis, to standardized graves, often linked together constructionwise, creating grave nuclei, the city blocks of the
necropolis. This opens discussions on how the new necropolis layout influenced the way the living interacted with each other
and their dead; to what extent city society was transferred to reflected in the graves; how the graves and the dead in a nucleus
related and compared to each other; and how within one nucleus the various graves would have entirely different histories from
the Roman to Middle Byzantine Period.
