by tearing down existing city blocks, like in Freiburg (Germany). While the public square is basically defined by its openness, the
question arises if it can be seen as a city block, despite its apparent lacking buildings. Therefore, the focus shall lie on this element of the city, because is often neglected, although it can give an important insight into the city’s development and structure
as well as a reflection of the economic, social and political changes in the city. On the one hand the public square can be studied
as an urban entity of its own, regarding its development and appearance. On the other hand, it forms an architectural, but also
functional complex with its surrounding buildings, for which reason a study of their interaction can give an interesting insight into
structural and functional developments in the city itself. Shifts in importance and perception concerning this urban unit in connection with other city blocks could be traced, giving a picture of the social, physical and functional dynamics in the city. Though
the lack of buildings renders the public square an empty city block, the square should be regarded as its own neighbourhood, as
the open space clearly gives just another example of a “lived space” in the medieval city.
