Presentation Format: Poster
Archaeological research undertaken at Aegyssus (Moesia Inferior, later province Scythia, present-day SE Romania) from 1971 to
1995/1998 has led to partially setting light on the history and evolution of the ancient city. After twenty years of archaeological
campaigns a series of contexts ranging from early Roman period to the Middle Byzantine time were investigated. The most important building investigated so far is a Roman bath complex bordered by an area that might be connected with a residential core.
In 2015, there was the restart of archaeological excavation, after almost twenty years of cessation, which shed new light on this
archaeological site. Traditionally research employs a positivistic approach and nothing has been done for carefully registration of
the strata. During last two years, new methods were employed for the study of the site, including aerial photogrammetry using an
UAV, with different cameras, and a caesium magnetometer for investigations. The authors would like to present an overall image
of the ancient site from the old excavations to the new finds from 2015 campaign onward. Main aim is to present a holistic point
of view of the ancient site, its urban planning evolution and a number of possible directory lines for the enhancement of the local
heritage focus on the Lower Danube in connection with the major trends in European archaeology.
This research was supported by a grant of the Romanian Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0852 (within PNCDI III) and through an annually grant offered by the Tulcea Municipality.
