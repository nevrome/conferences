Using just a smartphone and the right software, we can reproduce a 3-dimensional model of an excavation site in a highly-detailed
resolution. Up to date, we are able to generate 3D-models of objects in different scales, of excavations on land and underwater,
buildings, ruins or even whole landscapes. Today the creation of 3D-data is a widely accepted and an established procedure in
Archaeology without being standardized yet.
While drawing with a pencil is becoming an obsolete technique, we instead face new challenges of creating reproducible workflows, how fully exploit and how to store digital data: After data-production, the question rises what scientific benefit can the
data provide for research? What yet unsolved questions can be addressed with the analysis of 3D-data? In short: Does the
acquisition of 3D-data have an additional scientific value?
