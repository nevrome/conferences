Working with these techniques, we face an abundant amount of data not only to be analyzed but also to be stored. Do we need to
archive all the raw data for future analyses or could we reduce the amount of bytes to store? How can a large quantity of data be
handled for easy exchange between different researchers and different software-solutions? And how do we prevent information
loss for future generations?
In this session, we invite researchers working with 3D-scanning techniques to tackle these pressing questions and to share
Open Source solutions for data sharing, further analysis and storage.
The aim of the session is to discuss and to evaluate how to manage 3D-data in a meaningful way for scientific purposes and to
find new ways to address the risks and challenges posed by digitalization.
In short: Where are we, where are we going, and how do we want to design the handling of 3D-data in Archaeology?
