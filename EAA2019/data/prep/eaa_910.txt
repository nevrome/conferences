In 2017 the office for cultural heritage management of the Canton of Zurich has defined 3D-documentation with structure from
motion (SfM) in Agisoft Photoscan as a new standard. The past two years have shown the advantages of the method, especially
when documenting complex 3D structures, like skeletons or ruins, on site. The technology is also used for the capturing of whole
sites by drone. The resulting orthophotos serve as background for mapping in ArcGis.
While generating 3D-models was a path well paved, the storage of 3D-models needed some exploration. The first challenge
was to include the SfM-data into the current old-fashioned archive system and IT-infrastructure. The second challenge was to
secure an easy access for everyone and long-term storage at the same time. The current solution treats access and storage as
two separate matters. In order to view the content without limitations, each model will be available as a stand-alone application
(e.g. 3D-PDF, Potree-Model). As for the long-term storage, the same models are maintained in a normalised geometry file (e.g.
STL/OBJ-file). Long-term standards for 3D-data have yet to be established. Therefore, a backup-system was added by keeping
the raw-data (photos) along with the processing report for replication purposes. Our solution comes with a lot of redundancy.
However, this is still a trial and error approach, one that we would like to discuss with fellow 3D-enthusiasts.
