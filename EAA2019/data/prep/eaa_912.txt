Over the past few years, attempts have been made to fix petroglyphs in digital form, including 3D scanning. These methods allow
getting a digital image with the better quality and accuracy. Up to now methods of digital documentation of petroglyphs, including 3D have been testing on single separate objects. The task of large-scale working on hundreds and thousands of objects is

At the same time, such work would make it possible to increase the accuracy of documentation of rock art monuments: with high
