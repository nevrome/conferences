resolution, without geometrical distortions, including its third dimension and without the influence of a subjective factor. Also,
work with the rock drawings in the field could be non-invasive and less time-consumed, and the results of the laboratory work
would become reproducible on the basis of primary photographic materials. Having a three-dimensional model, it is possible to
create a side-illumination of a drawing with program methods, programmatically measure the parameters of an object, including
the depth of the mark, etc.
To represent three-dimensional models, a specialized information system in the web was developed with 3d-viewer based on
the open source three.js library. Using such a self-written software product, it is possible to make a flexible adjustment of the
functionality and design of the information system, including the implementation of an individual role-based data access model,
tools for analyzing archaeological images in 3D form, etc. At the core of the data storage model there is modern and one of the
most lightweight 3D formats â€“ Draco from Google Open Source.
This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project 18-78-10079).
