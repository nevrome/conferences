In the past years, means of acquisition of 3D information became all present - the requirements to successfully create an accurately reconstructed copy of an object in 3D dramatically plummeted and made the process broadly available to both professionals and enthusiasts alike. The IBM (Image Based Modelling) on it’s basic levels required only a camera and some overcast sky
or studio light, to have your site, your trench or a newly uncovered artifact, preserved as accurately scaled digital copy, for as
long as the storage units would hold the data. The more important question has been treated as of late - what to do with created
models, and what value do they add to the research work, if any?
Project ”People of Lepenski Vir: protocols for digitalization of bioarchaeological heritage” used number of techniques to capture
and store 3D data of the osteoarchaeological record from Danubian gorge, dated to Mesolithic and Neolithic period. Laboratory
for Bioarchaeology aimed to provide open access to the so created 3D models. In order to enrich the experience, basic functions
of metric data collection, surface model visualizations, model section analysis were added; but more importantly a robust database structure was created and populated to provide for metadata for each scanned fragment of bone. This structure allowed
for further expansion of the collection, to other sites and periods.
In this paper, we present experiences gained, with special note on the benefits of having an open access to 3D collections of the
archaeological material, for the purposes of education and information exchange.
