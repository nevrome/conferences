Tetzcotzinco is one of the most important and best preserved archaeological sites of the Aztec area. Tetzcotzinco is mainly
known for a monumental garden complex planned by the ruler of the city of Texcoco â€“ Nezahualcoyotl. This enormous complex
served for entertainment of the royal family. This garden also was one of the largest botanical collections of the world in 15th
century. Like other Mexican garden complexes, Tetzcotzinco also served for symbolic functions, expressed the worldview and
acted as place of celebrating the rituals. Today, Tetzcotzinco is an archaeological site with the most numerous remains of a hydraulic system and various stone and monolithic buildings from the Aztec times.
The paper aims to present the results of the documentation of the Tetzcotzinco site, using 3D scanning, photogrammetry, and
photography. The three-dimensional models create a rich base for researches on the issues of construction and renovation of
Aztec remnants on this site. We will also present one of the main goals of our researches: the reconstruction of the actual form
of the architecture at Tetzcotzinco and the attempt to trace the changes and damages that affected it. In addition, the effects
of documentation and 3D scanning will be used to reproduce the plans of the entire rich hydraulic system at Tetzcotzinco. All
the collected materials were used to create an interactive GIS database, which collects all the data on the construction of this
pre-Hispanic complex.
