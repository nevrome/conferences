Since 2015, the Freie Universität Berlin has conducted a major research project under the direction of Prof. Monika Trümper
within the TOPOI Excellence Cluster framework, investigating the development of Roman bathing culture at Pompeii. The work
involved excavation and standing remains assessment at two key bathing complexes of the city, the Republican and Stabian
Baths. During the fieldwork carried out from 2015-2018, structure from motion technology was used for several aspects of
the project, from archaeological documentation in the trenches to detailed assessments of the impressive standing remains,
particularly so for the Stabian Baths.
Building on this experience, this paper seeks to address some key points of importance for the work with large SFM data sets
that were encountered over the past years. In addition to addressing the themes highlighted by the session organisers, this will
include a discussion of the development of standards for the creation and use of SFM models, with particular regard to accuracy,
LOD (Level of Detail), Scientific Value, and georeferencing, among other aspects – although experience shows that demands
vary from project to project. In addition, the paper will address the different needs (and possibilities) faced by the excavators and
the standing remains assessors involved in the project and highlight the potential the technology offers for reconstruction of
technical and engineering aspects of complex buildings such as Roman Baths.
