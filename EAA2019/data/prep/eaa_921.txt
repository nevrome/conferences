The study of the technological traces detectable on the archaeological finds is fundamental for the reconstruction of the gestures of the past in any prehistoric research. In fact, the technological traces act as a “fingerprint” of the instrument that produced them, and, indirectly illustrate the hand that made them. The working surface where the technological traces are present
is not completely flat and it is generally rough and uneven due to post-depositional alteration. The proposed research examines
new methods for the three-dimensional analysis of the technological traces, taking as reference the geometrical characteristics of its working surface. This combined analysis can indeed be an additional advantage to the study of technological traces,
opening a wider space for interpretation. In this study, mentioned methodology has been tested on stone and bone replicas of
mobiliar art from prehistoric contexts from Italy and Spain. After the creation of experimental technological traces, we analyzed
and documented them with a Dinolite® digital microscope. During this phase, the working surface of the experimental replicas
was positioned at different angles keeping its focus of the digital microscope unchanged, in order to collinear the different captured images. The photos produced were processed through an image-based software for the creating of real numerical models
