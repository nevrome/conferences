Non-destructive investigation as well as modern documentation and presentation techniques present an appealing alternative
to conventional methods employed to uncover, document and examine block excavations. The application of three-dimensional
(3D) computer tomography, 3D printing as well as 3D photogrammetry provides a quick, easy to use, reliable and inexpensive
means to investigate and record archaeological structures and cultural artifacts. Further advantages over conventional techniques include the three-dimensional presentation of archaeological findings in situ as well as the valuable information on the
composition and structure that 3D imaging provides. For some time now, 3D methods have been employed in archaeological settings where they produced good results. The limitations and requirements of applying these non-invasive methods, however, are
rarely discussed. Therefore, based on the example of the late Mesolithic block excavation found in Rathsdorf (Märkisch-Oderland/Brandenburg), this paper aims to present and discuss the benefits and disadvantages of 3D techniques over conventional
excavation methods.
