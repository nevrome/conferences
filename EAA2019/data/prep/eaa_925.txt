The evolution of the 3D modelling techniques and the development of more efficient systems for the visualization of digital data,
highlight the added value given by the use of these methods in the archaeological field. This technology can be applied to the
world of Cultural Heritage as a vessel for preservation, reconstruction, documentation, research and promotion.
This paper presents a workflow methodology in order to obtain the casted object from eight moulds, found during the excavation
activities of the Iron Age site of the Questura in Padua, Italy. These objects, dating to the VIII century BC, were recovered from
a pyrothecnological productive area of the site, which gave back many elements of the metallurgic workflow, but an extremely
limited number of bronze artefacts.
The eight moulds, carved on one or more surfaces to allow the maximum exploitation of the lithic support, were acquired with
a 3D scanning system. With the 3D high resolution models, obtained from the post processing phase, the carved valves were
isolated and treated with a Reverse Engineering procedure in order to “digitally” cast the artefacts.
