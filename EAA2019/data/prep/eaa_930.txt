coastal buildings, increased acidic rainfall is causing greater rates of erosion, creeping desert sands are crushing ruins, and
record-breaking winds are causing monumental collapses. There is a renewed sense of urgency to record and attempt to save
medieval buildings at risk.
Archaeologists cannot stop climate change nor eradicate many of the challenges facing medieval buildings; however, is the sector doing enough to make a priority of saving buildings at risk? Are local solutions adequate or is a broader approach required?
This session invites papers documenting medieval buildings at risk from any challenge particularly, but not restricted to, climate
change. Furthermore, stories of success and failure in relation to restoration, preventive conservation, planning legislation, as
well as exploratory papers examining possible solutions are welcomed.
