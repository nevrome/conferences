Presentation Format: Oral
Norwegian medieval towns are subject to extensive urban transformations and renovations which have triggered large archaeological projects over the past decades. It has resulted in the in-situ restauration and preservation of many sites and vestiges of
various dimensions with good results. Still, there is little indication that the layperson is either informed or involved.
In-situ museums tend to not be integrated in the planning and life of the city and thus lie separated from the public understanding
of the urban development and history of the city. This is thus an underused resource for city planners and urban developers and
for the general public.
We will approach the topic through a case study of in-situ building remains from archaeological excavations in Trondheim, with
particular focus on the medieval period (from AD 1000 to 1550). They will be analysed in the light of the national and international
debates currently surrounding the methods used to disseminate information and research about excavation of medieval building
sites.
