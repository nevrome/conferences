THREE NOBLE MEDIEVAL DWELLINGS IN CARDONA (BARCELONA): THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO
UNDERSTAND HERITAGE BY THEIR OWNERS
Author(s): Pancorbo Pic√≥, Ainhoa (Town Hall of Cardona)
Presentation Format: Oral
Besides the well known outstanding heritage in Cardona enjoying the maximum legal protection, as the castle and the Romanesque canonical church, both presiding the medieval town, we can also find three other buildings scattered inside the gothic
wall of Cardona which can be defined as palaces or noble dwellings. Located below the hill of the castle, and therefore visually
communicated, two of them can be traced back to the 13th century while the third one is a Rennaissance building probably built
above a medieval one. Apart from analyzing the typology of these three interesting buildings and its distribution and comparing
them with other well known parallels near them, in this paper we are going to study how their owners faced the challenge of its
preservation once the properties, in really bad conditions, came into their hands; in which state we found them around year 2000,
and how we currently find them. We are also going to review the knowledge the neighbors had about them at the beginnings and
which one they have nowadays. In summary, we are going to see three extremely different ways of understanding heritage and
therefore three different ways of preserving it and leaving it to our descendants.
