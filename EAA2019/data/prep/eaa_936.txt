HERITAGE AT RISK: ISSUES, IDENTITIES, AND SOLUTIONS
Author(s): Kerr, Sarah (Trinity College Dublin)
Presentation Format: Oral
Ireland and Britain suffered considerable damage to their standing archaeology during a series of storms in 2018. These monumental losses coincided with the report by United Nations/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (October 2018) which
detailed the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, including an increase in the severity and incidence
of extreme weather events, such as cyclones. The report argues for a cross-regional response to climate change, and discusses
detrimental impacts to ‘social and cultural assets’. Several European-level reports indicate that an interdisciplinary approach
must be implemented to tackle this and other societal challenges (E.g. European Commission 2013, 163; European Commission
2017, 16).
This paper will introduce a number of case studies deemed at-risk from climate change-related storms and the specific challenges facing each. The potential impacts on cultural identity will be examined, through the prism of medieval building loss, drawing
on interdisciplinary theories and approaches. The third element of the paper will explore the local and national strategies in place
to tackle these issues set within the European context.
