Across Europe, only recently is the scientific potential of the buried archaeological deposits within castles being more widely
realised, having often been overlooked in favour of the protection and consolidation of standing remains, developments such as
reconstruction and rebuilding projects. Current frameworks for protection and research strategies vary greatly across Europe in
relation to the significance that is ascribed to the archaeology of castle sites.
We present soil micromorphology results from castle sites in Britain (Scotland), Estonia, France, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Spain and
The Netherlands, representing a diverse range of cultural and environmental contexts. Micromorphology can be used to refine
the stratigraphic sequence, to identify activities at high resolution from first construction phases or, in characterising the
changing use and, following decay, the re-use occupation of structures. Detailed understanding of these phases and hiatuses
in use is important for understanding the role of a castle in its wider landscape. Furthermore, micromorphology enables the examination of the differential preservation of plant remains and the identification of organic materials in a variety of forms, which
are crucial components for understanding the diet, livestock management and economy within a castle and the exploitation of
its hinterland.
We highlight the requirement for robust scientific analysis of buried stratigraphy if it is uncovered by building activities that
include the conservation and renovation of the standing architecture and the removal of rubble, which can unseal buried archaeology and affect its preservation. Micromorphology data can be used to develop and drive pan-European heritage research and
management strategies of buried archaeology at medieval castles and connect these sites with their landscapes.
