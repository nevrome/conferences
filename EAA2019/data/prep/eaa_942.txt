GAPING THE BRIDGE: EVENT AND PROCESS IN LANDSCAPE ARCHAEOLOGY

Presentation Format: Oral
Events are triggers. Well, otherwise archaeology might be in a bad state. Events trigger processes? Or is it the other way around?
Doesn’t matter, we determine which interpretation we prefer as a narrative for change and development. We are creating the
longue durée. Of course, constant development in the materialization of ideas and concepts are essential components for the
interpretation of archaeologically relevant societies and their adaptation strategies to their immediate environment. But ultimately all innovations lead to collapse - either on the process-oriented axis of socio-economic parameters or because of shortterm changes in environmental conditions. But what does short-term mean? And on which scales do event and process differ
regarding the interpretation of social, cultural and economic changes? Despite their periodic recurrence, events are masked
by long-term developments and are therefore not perceived as actual triggers. This is reflected in the classification and thus
modeling of processes that simulate structures and patterns. In reality, they are simple adaptations to periodic events. This
article aims to discuss the integration of long-term and short-term monitoring of landscapes and human behavior in terms of
their impact on natural feedbacks.
