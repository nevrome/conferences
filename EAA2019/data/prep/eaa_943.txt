FROM HOBBES, ROUSSEAU, AND MAUSS TO THE CARICATURE OF HUMANITY IN ARCHAEOLOGY

Presentation Format: Oral
Only a few books had a comparable impact on the archaeological research as Marcel Mauss’ eminent ‘Essai sur le don’. But since
its publication, the connection between donator and receiver of a gift as well as the question of why gifts are returned are recurring topics in anthropology and sociology. The discussion about reciprocity can be condensed into a non-individualistic, normative and an egoistic, utilitarian notion – the modern dichotomy of altruism and egoism is omnipresent. While the concept of
individualism is associated with Thomas Hobbes’ ‘Leviathan’ and Adam Smith’s ‘free hand’, the normative approach can be traced
back to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
This dichotomy is deeply embedded in Western thinking and can be identified in the archaeological literature on pre-modern
economies: most interpretations of prehistoric exchange refer selectively to the non-individualistic views and/or apply the individualistic approach without any reflection. At the same time, authors stress that an application of the selfish approach is only
possible for modern societies. As a consequence, archaeologist tend to characterise prehistoric actors as altruistic and cooperative, while modern (capitalistic) actors shall be egoistic and uncooperative. Humans are neither completely egoistic nor perfectly cooperative and if we want to deepen our understanding of prehistoric societies, we have to be aware of our reconstructions and models of past action. My lecture pleads for a stronger dialogue between both positions, a more reflective approach to
the reconstruction of prehistoric actors, and an awareness of the limitations of both extreme positions.
