ported by the grant 2018/29/B/HS3/01201 from the National Science Centre of Poland aims at the introduction of a parameter
‘informational capacity’ into simulations. More specifically, the following issues are addressed. Can the information capacity be
weighted or should it be involved into modelling as some unknown? How the informational capacity corresponds to systems of
memory in prehistory? What social, economic and spatio-demographic parameters influence the increase or decrease in the
informational capacity? The related tests make possible to link the culture theory and complexity theory, allowing the application
of well-known models from the latter to archaeological data and re-framing the basic concepts of our discipline.
