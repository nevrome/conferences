Quantitative models that seek correlations between archaeological remains—traces of ancient behavior—and the environment have been attacked as de-humanizing and narrowly focused because they ignore influential factors that cannot be readily
mapped and quantified, and can become environmentally deterministic. In fact, this critique helps to clarify the areas in which
quantitative site-location modeling holds the greatest promise. Quantitative analysis aimed at addressing narrowly formulated
questions about phenomena that are strongly constrained by geography can significantly advance our understanding of the
ancient world. Taking an inductive approach that analyzes the changing correlations between archaeological remains and the environment in chronologically specific periods allows for an analysis of human-environment interaction that avoids environmental
determinism. This paper describes a method of location analysis that investigates agricultural intensification on the Roman
frontier and the potential role of military forts as market centers in the rural economy. Intensifying labor input in agriculture is
constrained by the distance between settlements and fields, and the output of such a system is constrained by the physical
character of the landscape; marketing practices that require frequent trips between the place of production and the place of
exchange are heavily constrained by the distance between the two. Thus, both are susceptible to investigation through location analysis. The models presented here are not intended to be comprehensive accounts of all of the factors that influenced
settlement location. Rather, they aim to contribute to specific debates about the economic impact of the Roman military in the
frontier zone.
