Current behavioural research often focuses on statistical reasoning based on a wide array of base data. Moreover, current development of archaeological theory is characterised by the range of coexisting paradigms, which marks the crisis of ideas. Modelling demands simplification therefore creating a caricature of the society. It is not only based on the researchers own theoretical
background, but also deeply influenced by the perception of the organisational state of a society. Whilst embracing arte- and
ecofacts as a reflection of complex behaviour their generative process, meaning and impact often remains unclear, disputable
or is generally based in theory.
