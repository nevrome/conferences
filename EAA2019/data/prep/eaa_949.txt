In past year’s session no. 397: Modelling the past: Crisis of ideas in modern archaeology” we have seen multiple approaches to
theoretical archaeological modelling. In this talk we aim to streamline our ideas and attempt to discuss how the middle ground
between generic theory modelling and detailed structuring of data might look like in the future of archaeological theory. Summarising the two sessions we aim to lay the framework for a new synthesis which respects the explanative strengths of different
paradigms and harnesses the integrative power of modelling.
