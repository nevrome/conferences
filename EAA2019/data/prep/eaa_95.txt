Presentation Format: Poster
The castle of Cervelló, whose first written reference dates back to the year 904, is placed on the top of a hill currently accessible from the road that leads to the upper urbanizations of the town. In the middle ages it could only be reached by a path from
the side of the hill, where a big squared tower controlled a large landscape and watched the rest of constructions scattered on
both sides of the path. Amongst them, there is a chapel, a cistern and vestiges of different other structures discovered under
bushes and brambles. Some meters down from de castle we can also find a Romanesque church with a necropolis associated
to it, composed by several anthropomorphic tombs. All these structures were used during a long period of time. The castle was
seriously damaged in 1462 though all evidences show that it was rebuilt. But it definitely collapsed in the first quarter of the
18th century. Since 2010 the town council has made a great effort to highlight all these structures within its landscape as well
as to make them accessible for all kinds of visitors. In this poster we try to explain both the structures that make up the castle,
the church and the associated habitat, as well as their role in medieval times, and how the restoration works have reversed in a
better knowledge of the whole ensemble.
