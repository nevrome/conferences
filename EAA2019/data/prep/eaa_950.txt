GENDER AND TECHNOLOGY IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES OF EVERYDAY LIFE (AGE SESSION)
Theme: Interpreting the archaeological record: artefacts, humans and landscapes
Organisers: Chang, Claudia (Independent Scholar) - Franklin, Kathryn (University London Birkbeck) - Palincas, Nona (Institute
of Archaeology, Bucharest)
Format: Regular session
Feminist Technology Studies (FTS) have contributed to science and technology studies by examining how tool-use, work, and
object production reflect gender differences. A more radical feminist perspective would argue that technologies in fact produce
or mediate those differences. Yet archaeological studies of tool-making and work which examine chaînes opératoires (steps in
the process of making objects) and les techniques du corps or bodily practice often overlook the complex relationship between
gender and technology. In this session we invite participants to question and challenge models that subordinate the roles of
women in technological production; or, conversely, which minimalize the cultural significance of ‘feminine’ or ‘domestic’ technologies and economies.
Archaeological research over the past several decades has demonstrated the centrality of technology in constructing historical
ideas of gender, and of gendered ideologies in shaping archaeological approaches to politics, economy, architecture, and other
spheres tied to technology. In particular, the concept of gynotechnics, referring to the ways that the labor of women constructed
not only their embodied identities as women, but the moral universe of their society as well. We would extend the scope of this
concept and invite session participants to investigate archaeological case studies of cosmotechnics: the role of technologies
in constructing interlocking cosmologies at the scale of body, personhood, gender, space, and society. We aim for a session that
problematizes the intersection of gender and technology in the multiple modes described above. We will examine both the important role of domestic/household/ “feminine” technological productions of cloth, pots, cooking and even reproduction within
larger symbolic, ideological, and political contexts of ancient societies.
