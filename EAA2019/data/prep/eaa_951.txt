The aim of this talk is to analyze the intertwining of pottery production and the construction of a femininities in the Late Bronze
Age (approx. 1550-1350 cal BC) in the region between the Southern Carpathians and the Lower Danube. The analysis is based on
the stylistic and contextual analysis of artefacts as well as on ceramic archaeometry.
The stylistic and contextual analysis of artefacts indicate that the spheres of femininity and masculinity had been clearly separated at the level of ideology at least since the later Middle Bronze Age, with masculinity associated with group leadership, warfare and outdoor labor and femininity associated with the domestic sphere, and in particular with pottery production, cooking,
serving food and fashionable table manners as well as with the production of cloth.
The stylistic analysis of the Late Bronze Age pottery indicates that this was probably the main medium for the renegotiation of
gender relations. This included the assertion of a higher status for (some) women (and a consequently an overt challenging of
male authority), as seen from the introduction of gynomorphic symbols in pottery decoration alongside long established sun cult
related symbols.
Recent technological analysis of ceramics suggests that while in some areas this was produced by local potters, in others it was
made by itinerant potters, in contradistinction to the women-at-home ideology.
In addition to the aforementioned sets of data, this paper will resort to the concepts of gynotechnics and cosmotechnics in an
attempt to explain how a new type of femininity emerged in connection to pottery production and the use of old and new religious
symbolism.
