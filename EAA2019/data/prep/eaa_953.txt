furniture of textile craftsmanship (loom weights, spindles whorls, combs...) is examined and the analysis of its design and iconography makes it possible to understand its representation in the set (belts, fibulae, pins...) based on European comparisons.
All common textile objects or their figurative forms are considered as a cultural expression that plays a key role in the creation
and transmission of the dominant ideology, very well established in the societies of protohistoric Europe, using recurrent imagery (the solar pattern associated with weaving) and of which the weavers are the representatives.
The motifs of the solar loom or spindle whorls enhance the objects with their characteristic shapes and are also used as an
ornament for clothing. These motifs can have a religious significance (divine patronage) or an economic and social significance
(privileged character of textile craftsmanship...).
In both cases, textiles play an important role in the imagination, over the continent and over time. The iconography of the loom
theme is perennial, but its formal evolution could be indicative of societal transformations.
Indeed, the role of women in this creative effervescence could go hand in hand with their growing role in society. We will therefore
seek to clarify it, both on a productive level in the context of textile craftsmanship, as well as on a symbolic level.
