FOOD TECHNOLOGY AND THE GENDERED COSMOLOGIES OF ROCK ART IN CENTRAL EURASIA

An ever-increasing number of scholars are publishing scientific analyses of faunal remains from Bronze and Iron Age Central
Eurasia. These analyses give us some insights into herd management techniques and overall consumption patterns of both
animals and humans. However, the analyses are not yet at a scale to allow us to distinguish differences within communities. Who
was responsible for procuring the food, and who was responsible for cooking it? Answering this question by analogy to ethnographic accounts of food production and consumption uncritically foists modern gender dynamics onto past societies and past
organizations of space. It may be that the analogy holds, but it is worth examining other lines of evidence to test whether or not
it does. Luckily, there are a number of studies of the rock art of Central Eurasia, and many of these studies speculate on the cosmologies of Bronze Age and Iron Age societies. In fact, much has been written about the relationship between spirits, the hunt,
and fertility and reproduction. I argue that extant analyses of rock art cosmologies may be used as another line of evidence to
help understand the domestic technologies of food production, and the interpersonal relationships behind those technologies.
In this paper, I make a preliminary survey of published analyses of faunal remains from Bronze and Iron Age Central Eurasia, and
link those analyses to local rock art cosmologies.
