THE DOMESTIC AND THE DEAD: RETHINKING GENDER REPRESENTATION IN PONTIC SCYTHIAN PERIOD
IRON AGE BURIALS

Presentation Format: Oral
Funerary technology, including but not necessarily limited to burial mounds and grave goods are still seen as direct reflections
of Eurasian Iron Age social structure and the gender identities that are seen to be encompassed by it. The scholarly focus on
single, often anomalous, massive burial mounds and the types and amount of their interred grave goods, such as Alexandropol
or Tolstaya Mogila in present-day south-central Ukraine, skew our senses of how gender and the ‘produced’ nature of funerary
technology and their aesthetics are inextricably intertwined and their importance in the numerous cosmologies that operate in
society. Few studies of Eurasian Iron Age mortuary practices explore critically how a different approach utilizing the lens of production, in both a performative/theatrical sense and technological sense, might reveal hidden political and cosmological facets
of Iron Age sociality.
I draw upon equally Judith Butler’s (2004) gender constitution as performative and Susan Stewart’s (2007) notion of the ‘remarkable’ (elements of identification chosen to be indexical of certain periods and events assigned to individuals) to demonstrate how Iron Age burials were steeped in political intentionality, manifested gendered power relations through the use of
gynotechnics, and ultimately conveyed a sense of morality and being-in-the-based on ideas of the ‘domestic’ that are often
overlooked or ignored. During the course of the presentation, I explore the remarkable nature of Pontic Iron Age social action as
related to funerary practices through a careful disassembling and reassembling of grave good assemblages, mound construction, and mortuary landscapes. Utilizing data gleaned from a modest population of mounds and burials from across south-central
Ukraine, I focus in particular on how burials and funerary activities were produced and intentionally manipulated as means to
legitimize, and reinforce, the cosmological and social ordering of Pontic Iron Age communities through carefully designed and
produced aesthetic displays.
