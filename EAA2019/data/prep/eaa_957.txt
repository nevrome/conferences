people in what is now Armenia within political relationships and cultural spaces. The paper will tack between historical, material,
epigraphic and landscape data, considering the ways that both ‘everyday things’ and ritual objects/spaces collaborate in the
making of material worlds. This conversation will center on the valleys of Vayoc’ Dzor in southern Armenia, but will, through the
scalar jumps enabled by material cultures, reflect on Mongol statecraft and broader Central Asian topographies of taste. The paper will develop the idea of <cosmotechics,> or technologies (including practices) which function both to constitute embodied
subjects, and to orient those subjects within a world that makes sense. At its broadest scale, this paper considers the broader
role of cosmotechnics in knotting together the worlds of the medieval Silk Road.
