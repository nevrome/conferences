Based on the plains of Kildare, the Curragh was the largest military camp in nineteenth-century Ireland. From the 1850s, the
camp was noted for a community of women who built a make-shift settlement adjacent to the military establishment. Colloquially known as ‘wrens’ because of their sod- and furze-built dwellings, the group of women included prostitutes, soldiers’ wives,
harvest workers, and their children. The women occupied a fraught position; tacitly accepted by the military for the services
they provided, while simultaneously being the subject of revulsion and moral panic. They eked a precarious existence, fashioning
homes from the earth of the plain and building-scraps scavenged from the military camp. Where contemporary accounts of the
women are largely penned by bourgeois reformers, this project seeks to use archaeology as a way to move toward a more emic
understanding of their existence, focusing on the creation of alternative domesticities, and practices of solidarity and mutual
care.
