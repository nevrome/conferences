POCKET COMPANION FOR THE FANCY: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALITY OF SEXUAL EXPRESSION
Author(s): O’Gorman, Laura (Centre for Gender and Women’s Studies, Trinity College Dublin)
Presentation Format: Oral
The negotiation and participation of all genders in illicit sexual congress after the American Revolution and into the nineteenth-century is viewed here through the brothel guide, A Guide to the Stranger. By the nineteenth-century, Philadelphia, was
one of the fastest growing cities in America, in which prostitution burgeoned alongside industrial development. Technological
advances such as the printing press and paper wrappers made of straw meant that low cost books could be manufactured on a
mass scale. Nineteenth-century sexual material culture in the form of licentious and sexually explicit literature challenged not
only social change, but also the government’s role in the intimate and private lives of individuals. Brothel directories are usually
treated as curiosities, but as material objects they provide a unique insight into the lives of women historically marginalised.
Brothel directories as objects embodied the essence of this illicit consumption and presented strangers and the uninitiated with
a guide to enjoy metropolitan sexual escapades. While mainly directed at men, the guide acknowledged women’s participation in
Philadelphia’s pleasure culture as well.
