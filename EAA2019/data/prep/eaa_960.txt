CONTEXTS AND AT THE IRON AGE SITE OF TUZUSAI

Presentation Format: Oral
Pottery vessels, long associated with women’s work, also enter into the domain of female domesticity when associated with the
presentation and serving of food in ritual contexts. Through ethnographic analogy and the analysis of archaeological ceramic
data, we address the broad question of how women’s work represents both household wealth, social ability to demonstrate hospitality, and ultimately the symbolic power women held in the domestic household over ceramic technology and its uses in ritual
contexts. In contemporary Kazakh contexts, the presentation of the main dish is placed in the center of the table or in front of
the most honored guests, while individual place settings of small plates and tea bowls are arranged, usually using the best China
pieces owned by the household. All this must be orchestrated by the head woman and her daughters, sisters and other related
women.
Detailed studies of the technology and typology of ceramic vessels at Tuzusai, an agro-pastoral Iron Age site in southeastern
Kazakhstan conducted by Zak in 2018 also show a differentiation of vessel sizes (pot diameters) and forms related to ritual
feasting events. We conjecture that the production, use, and exchange of these fineware and/or slipped and sometimes painted
vessels also represent the gynotechnics of a nomadic tradition steeped in the serving of meat, milk, and grain products.
