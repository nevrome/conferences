image used to portray archaeologists, especially among the general public and the media. In this paper I argue that our professional identity is closer to that “Indiana Jones” public image than we realize or wish to admit. This fact poses some problematic
gendered aspects of archaeological practice. I will explore how fieldwork and excavations have been defined historically as the
core of our profession and why women were excluded from fieldwork longer than from other aspects of the archaeological profession. Fieldwork as a gendered set of technical and methodological skills reinforced certain visual representations of women’s
participation in archaeology. This has had a negative effect on women’s employment in archaeology. These gendered notions of
skills, techniques, and methods employed by field archaeologists has also influenced the kinds of topics and research conducted by women archaeologists in the past and present.
Finally, I shall analyse how (young) archaeologists present their work in such a way to reinforce gendered stereotypes through
visual representations (photographs) and in social media.
