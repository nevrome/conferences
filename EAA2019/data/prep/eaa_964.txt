A HISTORIOGRAPHY OF LA TÈNE
Author(s): Collis, John, Ralph (University of Sheffield)
Presentation Format: Oral
In my contribution I want to present the historiographic background to the session, how interpretations moved from Keller’s
original statement that the finds from La Tène had nothing to do with the Celts, to the late 20th century claims that the origin and
spread of the Celts can be documented by the ‘spread’ of a ‘La Tène Culture Group’ from southern Germany, and why this is now
rejected. It will briefly deal with the change in Keller’s opinion in the 1860s, but why La Tène was not accepted on the continent
until Déchelette in 1914. The concept of La Tène Art is a British invention starting in the 1850s and 1860s with Daniel Wilson,
Westwood, Kemble and Franks, and later in the century by Arthur Evans, Romilly Allen and Reginald Smith. Déchelette linked
Evans’ idea of the origin of Celtic Art in southern Germany in the 5th century BC with d’Arbois de Jubainville’s linguistic interpretation of the eastward spread of the Celts. In the 1940s Jacobsthal changed the nomenclature, ‘Late Keltic Art’ becoming ‘Early
Celtic Art’ and the spread of the Art was then linked with the Celts by Pierre-Marie Duval and the Megaws, a view that dominated
into the 1990s. This ‘Culture Historical’ interpretation has been under attack since the 1980s, but it still frequently occurs in
popular books and museum exhibitions. The different uses of terms such as La Tène and Hallstatt as both chronological and
cultural has added to the confusion.
