FRINGE CELTS – SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE ON THE LA TÈNE CULTURE

Presentation Format: Oral
While concept of ‘Celts’ emerged from the Western Hallstatt Circle as more or less result of cultural evolution, in the south-east
Europe it was more contextual than chronological shift. The context and semantic value of the Early La Tène finds in this area
is quite different than in the central ‘Celtic’ area. Furthermore, the mechanism of transfer and integration of the Early La Tene
elements into local cultures is significantly different from the process that takes place in later periods of the Late Iron Age. In
later periods La Tène communities in this area are considered to be mixture of local people and incoming groups that were recognized as ‘Celts’. The situation is even more complicated if we have in mind that both ‘locals’ as well as incoming ‘Celts’, were to
some extent exposed to the La Tène Culture before they were merged into compact and recognisable cultural item. ‘Celtization’
and ‘Latenization’ are in this area significantly different concepts. It even seems that these are nothing more than processual
categories, each of them comprising of at least several models.
