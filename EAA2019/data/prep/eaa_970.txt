Belgium is located at the fringe of the so-called Celtic core area in Central Europe. This is already reflected in the use by 19th and
20th century researchers of the terms Celtic of Germano-Celtic to describe the Late Iron Age material culture. Looking at the
Belgian archaeological record the question arises how to define Celtic La Tène culture. The most visible elements are limited to
expressions of status as some finds on the 5th century site Kemmelberg and the rich burials of Eigenbilzen and Meeuwen-Gruitrode. Other La Tène burials contains sporadically artefacts related to Celtic style. The question arises of this Celtic ‘identity’ in
Belgium is limited to an elite group?
