One exception is the so-called ‘Ardennes group’ in southern Belgium. This group is best known by its burial site which contain
two-wheeled chariots and grave goods that can be related to the Champagne-Marne region in French. The strong cultural links
between the two regions have led to the suggestion of a potential immigration in the Ardennes region.
An interesting element in this discussion are the language studies by Gysselinck and Van Durme. They state in their studies that
the protohistoric language in Belgium was a conservative remnant of the Indo-European group, it so-called ‘Belgic’ or ‘language
of the northwest group’. Celtic language traces are almost absent while there are indications of a germanization process of this
language during the Iron Age. This is also reflected in the writing of classical authors who are referring to Germanic ancestry for
the local tribes in Belgium.
