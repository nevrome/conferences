opments in the field of the archaeology of death and burial can shed light on the rich spectrum of human responses to death and
interactions with the dead body in past societies. This session aims to bring together perspectives on a wide range of taphonomic methods that can be used to increase our understanding of the broad scope of variation in the treatment of the dead.
By inviting papers with a strong basis in both empirical data and social theory, the session strives to transcend the disciplinary
divide between the humanities and natural sciences in the study of archaeological mortuary contexts.
Research papers discussing recent developments within fields such as archaeothanatology, digital archaeology, histotaphonomy, biotaphonomy, geotaphonomy, actualistic studies of cadavers and forensic archaeology, with the aim to improve, evaluate
and/or standardize existing methods applied to the taphonomic study of human mortuary contexts are particularly encouraged.
We invite authors to actively reflect on how these new insights can contribute to our understanding of mortuary practices in the
past.
