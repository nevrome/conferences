The author has conducted human taphonomic research at the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University (FACTS).
The preliminary results, and possible implications for funerary archaeology, is presented in this paper.
Following uncharacteristic patterns of skeletal articulation in void depositions of human remains in in Iron Age ringfort in Scandinavia, experimental research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that skeletal disarticulation patterns proposed for
void burials in archaeothanatology might be container reliant. Three voluntarily donated human cadavers were placed in a supine
position in coffins (two, of which one was observable) and a larger over ground container (one donation). Variations in decomposition patterns is presented. The skeletal disarticulation is discussed in relationship to the, through archaeothanatology, often
observed void disarticulation pattern.
The study empathizes human decomposition processes that needs to be regarded in the study of human skeletal (dis)articulation in void depositions. The research aims at improving the understanding of site formation process in regards to human
remains.
