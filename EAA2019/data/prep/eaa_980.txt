Ancient cremated remains are, notwithstanding the modern technologies, one of the major challenges of funerary archaeology. Cremation is a funerary practice characterised by many actions and rituals that, at least in ancient historical sources, were
strictly regulated. Despite many of these actions are not identifiable today, cremated remains can still be analysed under the
taphonomical and tanatological aspect. At the date, the study of cinerary urns through the micro-excavation implies several
technical and practical difficulties, related to the incredibly fragile nature of the materials and the problems connected with their
documentation.
With the purpose of preventing these problems, since few years now the exploitation of MDCT technology is used to verify the
presence of grave goods and bones fragments inside the urn. After having verified the validity of this methodology, it has been
decided to use the MDCT to recognize the taphonomical characteristics of a cinerary urn, trying to reconstruct the different
rituals that took place in antiquity.
This paper will present our research on ancient cinerary urns with MDCT and will suggest a new methodological approach to study
the ancient cineraries with a completely non-destructive technique.
For this purpose more than 60 cinerary urns from different geographical and chronological areas have been analysed with MDCT.
This paper will consider many different cases, paying attention to the depositional and post-depositional processes that can be
recognize through the analysis of the relative density of the materials contained inside the urn, their stratigraphic disposition
