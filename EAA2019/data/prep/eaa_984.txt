Presentation Format: Oral
This research aims to shed light on the enigmatic Iron Age c. 800 BC-AD 43 mortuary practices in southwest Britain using a holistic approach of secondary data collection and primary macroscopic and microscopic analyses. The first part of the research
explores the various means of corpse disposal by compiling all available human remains data into a database allowing statistical comparison of burial characteristics (site, feature, context, deposit, and associations). However, the dead were subject
to various treatments prior to disposal, as indicated by different states of skeletal completeness in Iron Age sites. Data from
secondary analysis alone limits insight into aspects of a complex funerary rite, thus the need for a holistic study incorporating
microscopic examination is evident.
Thin section light microscopy of bone diagenesis has been proven to be a successful method to measure processes that a body
went through in the early post-mortem period (such as burning, preservation and exposure to the elements) and in what kind of
environment decomposition occurred. This research examines samples of Iron Age human remains in articulated, partially articulated, isolated, and fragmented states to compare the character of bacterial attack present on the different classes of bone.
This method will identify patterns in pre-depositional treatment throughout southwest Britain. Together with the secondary
analysis of human remains data, a more holistic reconstruction of Iron Age mortuary practices in this region will be achieved.
