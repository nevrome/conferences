mations in cemeteries and domestic settings, disarticulation and deposition in wetlands appear to have been utilized simultaneously across Britain. Despite this, the majority of the Iron Age population is “missing” from the record. This research focuses
on disarticulated human remains, which are found in myriad contexts across much of the country, and may provide the means to
locate these individuals.
Taphonomic analysis of such material is helping to develop a new understanding of peri- and post-mortem processes, and has
the potential to identify the funerary/mortuary practices that lead to disarticulation. Key among the debates within Iron Age
funerary archaeology is that of excarnation. Since at least the 1970s, sub-aerial exposure (excarnation) has been suggested as
the leading cause of the “missing dead” in the period, and the primary method of disarticulation. In the last 10-15 years however,
taphonomic research has brought this into question. Work by Madgwick (2008, 2016) and others has shown that, for the west of
England at least, there is little physical evidence for sub-aerial exposure practices.
Eastern England is, by comparison, relatively unstudied. Now, as part of an AHRC funded Ph.D. project investigating broader
mortuary practices in the Iron Age, macroscopic taphonomic markers have been analyzed in c.350 disarticulated bones from 58
Iron Age assemblages in eastern England. The resulting data gives an excellent insight into funerary practices for the region and
provides new evidence for the excarnation debate.
