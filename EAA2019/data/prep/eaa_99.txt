The Imazighen from North Africa settled in the Canarian Archipelago in the middle of the 1st millennium BC and developed a
culture on the islands that can be linked to native North African societies and magical-religious practices associated with the
religions of the ancient Amazigh. This entire indigenous culture, which had existed in the Canary Islands, began to disappear
irreversibly following the conquest and colonization of the Archipelago by the Europeans, which began in the Late Middle Ages.
Since then, all information about the indigenous world was clearly influenced by “western thought”. The colonial past has had
a clear influence on the development and evolution of ethnography and archaeology in the world. This framework has, in turn,
shaped archaeological heritage management, and consequently, the study of the interrelations between the colonial past and
archaeological studies.
This paper analyses the case of the indigenous culture of the Canary Islands, and its role in the current primary school textbooks.
Within the educational context, we analyse how heritage is portrayed in elementary school textbooks, comparing, for instance,
the case of the namely European/monumental heritage (Castilian monuments and buildings) versus the African/non-monumental heritage (Amazigh or ancient Canarian sites).
This paper highlights the role played by colonialism in archaeological heritage management and education. Our research analyses
the way in which monuments are preserved and understood by heritage professionals, teachers and the interested public. Finally,
we describe the numerous contradictions concerning the nature, origin, and context of the indigenous peoples.
