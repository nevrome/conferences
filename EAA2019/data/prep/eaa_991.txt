DIVERSITY AND THE PUBLIC TURN IN ROMAN ARCHAEOLOGY. PORTABLE ANTIQUITIES OF THE
NETHERLANDS (PAN) AS A CASE STUDY

Presentation Format: Oral
Over the last decade, the demand for public outreach and societal impact of any academic discipline has become louder: be
relevant, show what you are worth to the broader public, or you donâ€™t get funded. Citizen science is the new buzzword, although
it remains a challenge to really include citizen scientists into research, and to realise truly in-depth research at the same time.
Roman archaeology has a lot to offer to 21st-century society, because our Roman past can show how mobility and diversity went
hand in hand with state structures in a globalised world 2000 years ago. We do however need smart ways to communicate this
to the broader public and start building communities (partly) outside academia.
This contribution will raise the above issues, and provide a case study in which citizen involvement in science and meaningful academic research results are combined. The project Portable Antiquities of the Netherlands (PAN) studies archaeological
finds discovered by private individuals, often using a metal detector, and publishes these online, with the help of the volunteers.
Co-creation is now shaping a community of users/researchers. The PAN-database resulting from this project is a Fundgrube
for interesting patterns in the material culture. Research based on the database is able to demonstrate for instance Germanic
participation within the Roman province of Germania Inferior/Secunda. Connected with other classes of evidence, it can also be
used to highlight long-distance travel or migration. These results can be used to connect to contemporaneous issues in current
society.
