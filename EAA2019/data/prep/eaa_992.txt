DO THEY KNOW IT’S ROMAN? COMMUNICATING SCHOLARLY RESULTS TO A WIDE AUDIENCE
Author(s): Kienzle, Peter (LVR-Archaeological Park at Xanten)
Presentation Format: Oral
In 1977 the Archaeological Park at Xanten (Lower Rhine Area, Germany) opened its gates to the public. Ever since, the archaeologists and architects in charge tried to present archaeological results to a large number of visitors from various backgrounds and
various interests. The site of the former Colonia Ulpia Traiana has been saved from complete destruction by the development of
an industrial estate and the exploitation for gravel. Today the archaeological park at Xanten is one of the most visited and best
protected archaeological sites in Germany drawing more than 600.000 visits a year famous for its reconstructions and hands-on
experience of ”the Roman past”.
On the one hand, museum exhibits of original remains, information panels, protection shelters and reconstructions try to communicate the results of scholarly research in a complete, though understandable way. On the other hand, large playgrounds (with
Roman elements), living history and reenactment festivals draw large numbers of event-visitors. In the past, the park has been
criticized, predominantly by academics, for being a “sort of Disneyland” or to be destructive to the original remains underground,
but the park was also hailed by government executives for being a great example of presentation of the Roman past to an audience as wide as possible.
Based on the long experience on site, the contribution will explain the scholarly and scientific research at the site of the former
Roman city, the decision making process in the background, the reconstruction work and the presentation of the site and a reflection on the visitor’s perception of the Roman past.
