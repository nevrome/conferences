Presentation Format: Oral
Mauretania Tingitana was one of the African provinces of the Roman Empire. Situated on the North - West edge of the continent,
naturally isolated from the other parts of the Roman world. Not much is known about the system of defence in this piece of Empire. When the roman army appeared in the region at the 1st half of I AD the history of the living frontier had been started. Despite
of some previous theories, no traces of the limes can be proven and all the pieces of the frontier defence are still a great mystery.
The last research of the Polish - Moroccan team in Ain Schkour fort of the auxiliary unit can give an interesting insight in the
relations between the Roman garrison and the local inhabitants of the province. Many inscriptions discovered in Volubilis gives
us some idea about the ways of dealing with the local tribes and can confirm unusual character of the frontier zone in Tingitana.
