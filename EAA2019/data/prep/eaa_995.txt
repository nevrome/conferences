Format: Regular session
Since the 1970’ies archaeological and ethnographic studies (Gendel 1982, 1984, Hodder 1977, Wiessner 1983) have explored
the potentiality of arrowheads as a meaningful parameter for measuring the ethnographic identities of prehistoric groups and
the relationships among them. Later on, mainly in connection with the diffusion of technological studies, this assumption has
been questioned on different grounds although remaining one of the fundamental notions for the identification and definition of
past techno-complexes. This session aims at exploring and discussing the validity of this assumption by analyzing the archaeological and/or ethnographic evidence from different geographical and chronological contexts referable to hunter-gatherer as
well as agro-pastoral societies. By doing so the session aims at fostering the debate on the theoretical and interpretative implications of the study of material culture. Such a debate is expected to do not only focus on arrowheads and lithic tools but also to
include comparisons with other kinds of archaeological evidence such as ornaments, burial rituals, pottery and other technical
traditions etc.
