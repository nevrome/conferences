was first proposed by Schwabedissen, who also argued the Havelte point to reflect a transitional element between the classic
shouldered point and the subsequent tanged points in Bromme- and Ahrensburgian industries and thereby continuity between
the various Late Glacial cultures of northern Europe, an interpretation still supported today. However, radiocarbon-data speak
against this chronological division and indicates the two phases of the Hamburgian to be of a more synchronous nature. This
is underlined by the fact that Classic and Havelte inventories do occur together. Furthermore, the two ‘phases’ only differ in
the deliberate shaping of their diagnostic projectile points and not in any other aspect of their lithic repertoire. Focusing on the
south Scandinavian inventories, these are few and seemingly of an ephemeral and short-term character. The projectile points
within these inventories are all of the Havelte variant and almost identical across different sites. We cautiously interpret these
as having been made by individuals who are socially and temporally closely related. Instead of a diagnostic for an entire chronological phase, the Havelte points may be understood quite differently, as an individual variant within the classic Hamburgian. This
has major impacts for not only how we understand the Hamburgian, but also for how we understand Hunter-gatherer continuity
and discontinuity in Late Glacial northern Europe. A novel approach to interpreting the classic and Havelte relationship is here
presented with preliminary results.
