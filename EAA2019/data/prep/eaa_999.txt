WESTERN DENE ARROW DESIGN AND FUNCTION, NORTHERN CANADA
Author(s): Thomas, Christian (Government of Yukon)
Presentation Format: Oral
Bow and arrow technology spread throughout the northwest of North America, replacing the throwing dart, over a period of
2000 years before the colonial period of North America. The mountainous regions of southern Yukon, Canada, is one of the last
places this technology was adopted, and indigenous hunters maintained a bow hunting tradition until into the 1940s. In much of
Yukon-Alaska the technology is characterized by complex composite bone or antler points that are highly stylized. Importantly,
Dene arrows were designed for particular hunting situations, thus arrow styles were highly variable depending on the season
of use or the animal being harvested. In this talk we will compare examples of archaeological arrow technology recovered from
alpine ice patches at caribou and thinhorn sheep hunting territories to descriptions provided from hunters in a variety of Dene
ethnographies with the objective of better understanding the interwoven complexities of function, identity and spiritual belief
that can be observed in crafting styles.
